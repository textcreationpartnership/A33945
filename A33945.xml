            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Wherein the Arguments being weighed in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Sanctuary, are found too light; and the lawfulneſs of Private mens Preaching (as <hi>Tho.

            <p>My work in this Treatiſe hath been, and is, 1. To Rout him in all his Guards; 2. To diſcover the weakneſs and invalidity of all his Anſwers to thoſe Objections and Allegations by him there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for the Preaching of the Gifted Brethren.</p>

            <head>THE Pulpit-Guard Routed, In his twenty ſtrong Holds.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Meeting with your Book, ſubſcribed with this Title, <hi>The Pulpit Guarded, &amp;c.</hi> and perceiving the drift and end of the matter, with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, could not but judge my ſelf bound, as I tendred the honour of the Lord Jeſus, his Truth and Goſpel, his Saints and Servants (eſpecially ſeeing none elſe undertaking the work) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke this unclean ſpirit, and to caſt out this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to enter the liſts with, and to rout this unrighteous Guard. It poſſibly may ſeem ſtrange that I ſhould undertake this task, eſpecially becauſe this Guard was occaſioned, as you ſay, by a diſpute at <hi>Henly</hi> in <hi>Warwick-ſhire:</hi> But Sir, finding your Diſcourſe tending not only to reproach the Creature, but the Creator likewiſe, his Truth and powerfull free operation in his Saints, all which I finde my ſelf bound in conſcience for to vindicate, as far as light and truth in its power ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in me.</p>
            <p>As for the manner of my proceeding, 1. I ſhall not turn aſide after every vain and unworthy paſſage and miſcarriage in your Guard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I meddle with your particular Epiſtles, but I ſhall firſt give you ſome hints concerning the Title of your Book.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49506:4"/>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall diſcover your ignorance, falſhood, and folly, in your Looking-glaſs for Anabaptiſts, as you call them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſhall encounter with you in all your twenty Guards, and in the ſtrength of the grace of Chriſt, doubt not but that I ſhall rout you in them all.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I ſhall diſcover the weakneſs of your anſwers unto thoſe objections you produce for Laymens preaching.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, Your ſix Arguments to prove your Miniſters free from Antichriſtianiſm, examined, and found too light; and ſix more aſſerted, proving them to be Antichriſtian.</p>
            <p>And now Sir, to the buſineſs in hand; and firſt to the Title of your Book, <hi>The Pulpit Guarded.</hi> I have two words to minde you here.</p>
            <p>1. I perceive you are turned Souldier; Sir, are you not beſides your Calling? but whom do you guard? the Pulpit forſooth: what, doth the Pulpit want guarding? your high and holy place? are you yet ſuch Phariſees (notwithſtanding the light ſhines, and the Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is ariſing with healing in his wings) that you muſt have the uppermoſt rooms at Feaſts, and the chief ſeats in the Synagogues, and be called of men <hi>Rabbi?</hi> But Sir, in good earneſt, is it truth that the Pulpit needs your guard? are gifted brethren, as you call them, grown ſo high, as that they dare adventure into your Pulpit? and will you guard the Pulpit from them? and not only the Pulpit, but you would guard all preaching from them too: as there ever ſuch a thing as this heard of? what, to guard the Pulpit from preaching brethren? Did ever Chriſt and his Apoſtles do the like? did you ever finde any one in Scripture guarding the Pulpit and preaching from the Saints? I challenge you in the name of the Lord to come forth and produce any one in the Scripture; I ſay again any one, unleſs the Pope, or the Devill that hath done the like work as you have done. Was this the practice of Chriſt? <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 38, 39. The Diſciples ſeeing one caſt out Devils in the name of Chriſt, they forbade him, becauſe he followed not Chriſt; but Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Forbid him not; for there is no man which ſhal do a Miracle in my name, which can likely speak evil of me;</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, <hi>for he that is not againſt me, is on our part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 2. The perſons you mention with whom you diſputed, and as you ſay, occaſioned this Pulpit diſcourſe, was, a <hi>Nailer,</hi> a <hi>Baker,</hi> a <hi>Plough-right,</hi> a <hi>Weaver,</hi> and a <hi>Bakers-boy;</hi> and it appears clearly in this, and all your diſcourſe, in which you often mention them, that you mention them in way of reproach, as if it were a reproach and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49506:4"/> ſcandal for a <hi>Nailer,</hi> a <hi>Baker,</hi> a <hi>Plough-right,</hi> and a <hi>Weaver</hi> to preach the Goſpel. I cannot but take notice of two things in this particular; Firſt ignorance: Secondly envy. 1. Your ignorance, and that under two conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Ignorance, in not knowing; elſe wilfulneſs, in not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that God hath alwaies, and in all Ages of the world hitherto made, and will make uſe of men of Callings to be the Miniſters of his will unto the people, as <hi>Moſes, David, Eliſha, Peter, Paul, &amp;c.</hi> And I challenge you again to produce any example in the Scripture, that ever God made choice of any to be Miniſters of his minde unto the people, who were bred up idly all the daies of their life, without a Calling, as the Prieſts of our times have been: that whereas idleneſs is forbidden in all Ages, and God hath called men of particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to miniſter in the Goſpel, forſooth we muſt have idlers, and them only, Drones that never knew what it was to live lawfully in the world, by a particular Calling, that muſt be put into the Prieſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that they may eat a piece of bread, cloath themſelves with the wooll, and feed themſelves with the fat; and none muſt preach but themſelves, leſt their idleneſs and baſeneſs ſhould be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>There are many Prophets and Miniſters in the Scripture, their Callings are not mentioned.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True; but its enough, firſt, that many, nay moſt are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. 2. Idleneſs was forbidden, and was altogether unlawfull; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not judge that God made choice of idlers, becauſe they were ſo, nay that it is the devils choice, and Sodoms ſin, pride and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>The Miniſters are not bred up idly, as you ſay, but have particular Callings, being bred up to learning, which is a calling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is no calling; for a calling is that, in and by which men may in the ſweat of their face get their living, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 28. breeding to ſchool is proper to children, when they cannot labour, to fit them for ſome calling, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 6.</p>
            <p>Secondly ignorance, in not knowing that its that which tends moſt to the glory of God, and that wherein his power, wiſdom, &amp;c. is the more made manifeſt and magnified, in gifting weak ones; and this he doth that no man might glory in his preſence, nor in his own wiſdom, parts, arts, ſciences, &amp;c. that men might not give the glory to thoſe outward baſe things of the world, which belongs to God; and of this it ſeems you and the men of your generation are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49506:5"/> ignorant, worſe and more blind, if not wilfull then thoſe <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>When they ſaw the boldneſs of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant they marvelled, and took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jeſus:</hi> But you are ſo blind that you cannot take knowledge of your gifted brethren, that they have been with Jeſus, you are ignorant of that truth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Out of the mouth of babes and ſucklings haſt thou ordained ſtrength, becauſe of thine enemies, that thou mighteſt ſtill the enemy and the avenger:</hi> God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains ſtrength out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings, that way making his power and wiſdom to appear, that ſo he might ſtill the enemy and the avenger; but you are ſuch an enemy, that you will not take notice of Gods working in this way, but you will be an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the more, and avenge the more, and blaſpheme the free operation of the Spirit in the Saints, Phariſee like, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. a dangerous ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly Envy againſt the Lord, and againſt his people; <hi>envyeſt thou for my ſake?</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> Numb. 11. 29. <hi>Would God that all the Lords people were Prophets:</hi> Oh ſaith the Prieſt, but we will have no Prophets nor Preachers but our ſelves; its a profitable trade, by this we have our gain, our profit, our honour upheld, our back and belly clad and fed, our pride and ambitious luſts maintained; but if you ſuffer Mecanick fellows, men of Trades and particular Callings to preach, we loſe all, they will tell truth to the people; and for this it is you envy them.</p>
            <p>Now to your Looking-glaſs for Anabaptiſts, as you call them; Their firſt Tenent (and Error) you ſay is, <hi>That Infant Baptiſm is a childiſh needleſs thing, and that none muſt be baptized before they come to perfect age, and can make confeſſion of his faith, that Infant-Baptiſm came from the Pope and the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This I own for truth, although in many places you abuſe them, writing lying vanities, the viſions of your own head. I ſhall therefore briefly run through it. 1. Owning &amp; confirming their own principles, wherein your ignorance and wo will appear, in calling light darkneſs, and darkneſs light: 2. In diſcovering your folly and falſhood, in charging them with things they never owned, wherein your envy and malice will appear.</p>
            <p>The firſt Tenent I muſt ſpeak to in its parts. 1. <hi>That Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is childiſh, and needleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's truth, and that upon a double account. 1. As relating to the ſubject, the Childe, who is to be baptized, not underſtanding
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49506:5"/> what is to be done, neither the uſe and end of it; and I ſuppoſe you cannot but grant, that on the Infants part there is nothing but child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs from firſt to laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. The Infants of the Children of Iſrael were as uncapable in the underſtanding of the myſterie of Circumciſion as Infants are now of Baptiſm, yet they were by the command of God to be circumciſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I ſhall return a threefold anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. Its truth, that one part of Circumciſions myſterie, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the heart was as far from the capacity of Infants, as the myſterie of Baptiſm is now.</p>
            <p>Yet 2. As Circumciſion was a type and ſign in the fleſh, of Chriſt who was to come of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and was to continue till Chriſt and Grace was come, there was not ſuch a capacity required; for this was a Jewiſh and legal type, as all the reſt of their external Worſhips and Sacrifices were, leading to, or repreſenting of the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh; but this of Baptiſm a lively repreſentation and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the ſouls faith and knowledge of Chriſts being already come both in the fleſh and in the Spirit, without him and within him; as likewiſe a viſible demonſtration to the world of the ſouls owning this Chriſt thus come, for him, in him, by his Spirit, &amp;c. this is not to be found within the capacity of Children, Infants.</p>
            <p>But 3. There was a command for that of Circumciſion, but none for that of Baptiſm; and the command is it that gives the party a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of ſubmiſſion to the thing commanded: Infants of <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall ſeed were commanded to be circumciſed; Infants of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſeed, children of the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> are commanded to be baptized, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. from the 26. to the end.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Its childiſh as relating to the Adminiſtrators; and truly I think this is the moſt moderate term that you or I can give it; for <hi>Childiſh</hi> relates to ignorance, or want of knowledge; but I am afraid that in many of you its wilfulneſs: Childiſhneſs relates to ignorance; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>When he was a child, he underſtood as a child, &amp;c. And in malice be ye children, but in underſtanding be ye men:</hi> Your childiſh ignorance conſiſts in not underſtanding the command of your Lord, and the myſterie of his Covenant, only to and with the ſpirituall ſeed, thoſe in whoſe hearts his Law is written; not diſtinguiſhing between Law and Goſpel, Covenant of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and Covenant of Chriſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 32, 33. The Ordinances, Subjects, and Commands of the one and of the other, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 15. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49506:6"/>
            <p>2. Childiſh ignorance, wilfulneſs and untowardneſs, falling out with your brethren to whom God hath given more underſtanding in the myſtery of his will, reproaching, ſcandalizing Truth it ſelf, like children rejoycing in the counter, the bauble ſomething like the Truth, ſuffering your ſelves to be cheated by the Devil, and deluded out of the Truth it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And it being ſuch a childiſh thing, hence it follows, its a needleſs thing; no need of that which flows from ignorance, no need of that which is not required, its will-worſhip; and formerly you had ſo much reaſon and Religion in you, as to ſay that any thing done in the worſhip of God which had no command, was will-worſhip; but now when it concerns your ſelves, it ſeems the caſe is altered.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>And that none muſt be Baptized till they come to perfect age and can wake confeſſion of their Faith:</hi> And is this ſuch a ſtrange thing with you, who profeſs your ſelf a Miniſter of the Goſpel, as that you make it ſuch a dangerous Tenent as to ſcorn it, and to account thoſe who hold and practiſe it, ſuch dangerous Sectaries as you do? was not Chriſt himſelf baptized at thirty years of age, the <hi>Eunuch</hi> by <hi>Philip, Act.</hi> 8. and thoſe of <hi>John</hi> who came and confeſſed their ſins, and thoſe converted at <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon? and yet dare you to reproach this practice? would you not account Chriſt and his Apoſtles Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, if they were now living?</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>That was the firſt plantation of the Churches, but now the Churches are planted, therefore Infants are to be baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Was there one Rule for them in the infancy, and another for you now? If any ſuch thing, pray produce it, let us ſee the Scripture; but if no other Rule or Command to you, then was to them, be aſhamed and tremble for ever, to reproach this Principle and Practice, unleſs you be reſolved to deny Chriſt, and to be the great Antichriſt ſitting in the ſeat of God, exalting your ſelf above all that is called God.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>That Infant-baptiſm came from the Pope and the Devill:</hi> And I pray from whence came it elſe? Firſt, it came not from Chriſt, it is nowhere reckoned amongſt his ſayings, or the Apoſtles Writings: Therefore firſt it came from the Pope as your Calling did, and you brought it from <hi>Rome</hi> with you; therefore it was well confeſt by a man of your Coat, once diſcourſing about Infants-baptiſm, that it came from <hi>Rome;</hi> its true ſaid he, it came from <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo did we, for all was involved up in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion; but we are come forth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49506:6"/> and bring out our Ordinances with us, and ſo refine them, that they are now no longer the Ordinances of <hi>Rome</hi> but of Chriſt; were they once the Ordinances of <hi>Rome,</hi> and now of Chriſt! a ſtrange change, when the truth is that they are but Anabatized, or nick named with the name of the Ordinances of Chriſt; they are as much and as truly the Ordinances of <hi>Rome</hi> as ever; this is ſuch an evident truth, as that he that runs may read it. Secondly, it came from the Devil, I ſay, not becauſe it came from <hi>Rome,</hi> for the <hi>Pope</hi> poſſibly may hold ſome Truth; but if it came not from Chriſt, then it came from the Devil, and out of that bottomleſs Pit mentioned in <hi>Revelations,</hi> of mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions; The Devil and mans deceitful heart joyning and juggling together, forms up ſomething in the likeneſs of truth; this is that myſtery of Iniquity mentioned in Scripture, ſomething like truth, but is not truth; therefore wiſdom is required for the underſtanding of it, not your Univerſity Wiſdom, Arts and Sciences, but that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is from above, which is pure, peaceable, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Tenent you lay to their charge, is, That <hi>all gifted perſons may preach without Ordination.</hi> This likewiſe is ſuch an evident and undoubted Truth to all men living in the Light, that they are or may be ſo far from being aſhamed to own this Truth, as that it is or ſhall be your ſin and ſhame too, firſt or laſt, to reckon this among the Errors of the Saints; but this is that which hath been the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of your Diſcourſe, and ſhall be of mine in Anſwer to you: Therefore I ſhall paſs it in this place; onely one word take notice of; There is mention in Scripture of preaching by perſons in Office by Ordination and Gift; but I ſay not that you are the men; and there is preaching by way of Gift only; and although all gifted brethren preach not as men in Office and Ordained, yet all gifted brethren may preach for the edifying of the body of Chriſt according to the meaſure of the gift given them, <hi>Rom</hi> 12. 4, 9. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 31. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10. 11.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>That God reveals his will not only by the written Word, but by Dreams and Viſions, which they believe more then the word, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, if this be truth, that ſome do hold this Principle, is it ſtrange and ridiculous unto you? hath not God revealed truth to his people formerly by Dreams and Revelations? and dare you deny it, and reprove it now? is God limited, or his hand ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? although its true I ſay, that I believe God doth not often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal himſelf thus unto his people now: yet I dare not limit the holy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49506:7"/> One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to this or that particular way; and put caſe ſome may tranſgreſs in this particular, yet I dare ſay you as deeply trangreſs one the other hand: 1. To judg the thing it ſelf for the miſcarriage of ſome in it. And 2. In laying it as an <hi>odium</hi> upon all, when it is perhaps the judgement but of a few, if of any at all; for mine own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, although I dare not be ſo audacious as to judge the thing it ſelf, God having formerly revealed himſelf to his ſervants in this way; yet I know none who profeſs themſelves to have experience of this, <hi>viz.</hi> the knowledge of truth by Dreams and Viſions; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you know any ſuch, or no, or whether it be one of the whimſies of your head, I leave.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>They</hi> (you ſay) <hi>deny all conſequences from Scripture, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo clear, and require expreſs Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You are miſtaken, man, in this too; they deny unneceſſary and untrue conſequences, ſuch as you will often draw for your own ends; and if ſome tender ſouls will not permit you to draw any conſequences from Scripture, thank your ſelves for it, who have, by your many lying and falſe conſequences, given them juſt cauſe to ſuſpect you, and to believe none of your conſequences at all: your conſequences are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Baptiſm is come in the room of Circumciſion; infants were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, therefore infants muſt be Baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A goodly conſequence, as true as Scripture; if the people would but believe it, they ſhould never know that the Law and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion came by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and that Grace and Truth, and Goſpel-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances came by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1. 17.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Apoſtles baptized houſholds; there might be Children; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore children may be baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another goodly conſequence, as true as Scripture; if the people will but believe it, it is enough; and why may not the ſimple Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, as you account them, draw another conſequence that will devour, and ſwallow up yours at once? that is, There are no children mentioned in thoſe families; and if any, it was contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, and known practice of the Apoſtles to Baptize them; and families take their denomination from the major part, or the ruling part; therefore there might be no children; and if any, yet they might not be Baptized; therefore this is no good foundation for ſuch a practice. I could inſtance divers ſuch like conſequences of yours, as, Children were brought to Chriſt, therefore they may be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49506:7"/> Baptiſed &amp;c. but I can give you but a hint and away; but if ſome ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ones dare not believe your conſequences, thank your ſelves for it, in abuſing them ſo groſly in this nature.</p>
            <p>4. Tenet, <hi>That the Saints in this life are pure, without ſpot, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Sir, will you ſtill perſiſt in your wickedneſs and ignorance? hath not this been the language of the worſt of men in all Ages of the world againſt honeſty, and honeſt men? they are too pure, too holy; are you like them, ignorant of the Scripture? <hi>Cant.</hi> 4 7. chap 6. 9, 10. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 17. its true, in their own ſight they ſee their ſpots and ſins; but as related to the Lord in the covenant of Grace, they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in him, juſtified, clothed, and covered with his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there is no ſpot at all in them; and whereas you ſay they need not make uſe of that Petition, <hi>Forgive us our ſins,</hi> you manifeſt your ignorance of the truth; for that which they ſay, is, that while a ſoul lives in the enjoyment of mercy and love, its then form or cuſtom that carrieth him to that Petition; but when a ſoul apprehends the want of pardon, let him ask it.</p>
            <p>5. Tenet, <hi>No man can with a good conſcience, exerciſe the office of a Magiſtrate under the New Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This, with divers others, being altogether falſe, I ſhall joyn them up together, as being not worth the ſpeaking to in particular; the 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. I joyn up theſe together, becauſe they are all of them forged lyes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions come from hell of purpoſe to ſcandal Truth, and Saints; and therefore in this I ſhall be bold to ſay to you, as Chriſt to the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, <hi>You are of your father the Devil, becauſe his works you will do, for he was a lyar from the beginning:</hi> and its obvious to all mens know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, who are not willingly blinded, that they are honeſt in their Converſations, and prefer honeſty in their Congregations more then your ſelves; if they meet with any ſuch principles, or practiſes, they expel them, have no ſociety with them, nor their owners; they look diligently leſt any profane perſon ariſe, and defile others; but its your ſelves are the men that are guilty of theſe crimes you lay to others charge: I wonder how you durſt be ſo impudent as to charge that upon others, of which you are guilty your ſelves; your ſelves it is that entertain in your Congregations notorious offenders, adulterers, drunkards, ſwearers, &amp;c. and none comes amiſs with you; but if God begin to enlighten any ſoul to ſee into the evil and ignorance of his former wayes, he ſhall be the butt you ſhoot your arrows at, and you
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49506:8"/> judge him to hell preſently for a Sectary: Thus you feed not the ſheep, but wolves and goats with lyes and vanity, but you kill them that are fed.</p>
            <p>Your ſelves it is that are ſeditious and tumultuous. Who preached Parliament and King into a War at firſt in <hi>England,</hi> but the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and Presbyterian Factions, and left the Parliament again in their greateſt ſtreights, when you had but thoughts that your own intereſt would not ſtand? who are turned Traytors to their native Country, ready to joyn with <hi>Scots</hi> or Devil in the ruine of it? Your ſelves or thoſe you call Anabaptiſts? who are they, at preſent, that endeavour to kindle a fire in the neighbour Nations, to burn up their own? your ſelves, or the Anabaptiſts?</p>
            <p>In a word, who are they that refuſe, or at leaſt murmur againſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing fidelity to the Magiſtrate in the common good? your ſelves, or the Anabaptiſts? Let truth be judge, and acknowledge your miſtake, and be aſhamed for ever, thus groſly to belye the truth, and its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, laying your own blame and ſhame upon other mens ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>And put caſe there be any that pretend themſelves to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in that profeſſion you ſo much contemn, that diſhonour truth in any of theſe particulars mentioned by you: Yet how dare you ſay they are ſuch all of them, laying the ſcandal upon the whole, as if becauſe there was one <hi>Judas,</hi> all the Diſciples muſt be Hypocrites? But Sir, if we ſhould judge of you after this manner, we could ſay more of you, then you ſhall ever be able to ſay of us, I truſt: I could tell you of Prieſts Free-willers, Drunkards, Swearers, Whore-maſters; what not? ſhould I therefore ſay you are all ſuch men? but I forbear at preſent; only this, take heed how you take the Devils work upon you next, to accuſe the brethren; if not, I muſt ſpeak more at large unto you; as to the reſt of the particulars you mention, as the Twelfth, that Chriſt died intentionally for all; I ſay he dyed for all, although not intentionally to ſave all; for if he had intended to ſave all, he had not failed of his intention.</p>
            <p>17. <hi>That its unlawful to go Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is this ſuch a grievous errour with you? I anſwer, 1. That its chargeable to go to Law: and 2. That the Apoſtle reproves it as a ſin, and fault in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Dare any of you, having a matter againſt another, to go to Law before the unjuſt, and not before the Saints?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49506:8"/>
            <p>And yet you dare to upbrade the Saints who dare not go to Law, and yet you belye them too in reſpect either of perſons or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: 1. Of opinion, they deny not going to Law abſolutely, but in caſe of neceſſity, when no other way or means will ſerve; and that too ſecondly, when it tends to the prejudice of their livelihood and being. 2. Of Perſons, Its not all, but poſſibly ſome few tender ſouls dare not own going to Law in any caſe; and I wiſh all were more tender in this reſpect, although they become your reproach and ſcandal more then yet they are.</p>
            <p>18. <hi>That Wars are unuſeful,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, its the judgement but of ſome, and I believe of very few, that Wars are altogether uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their judgement is that Wars are uſeleſs in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, and that its uſeful only in the Kingdomes of the world amongſt men for the preſervation of civil Rights; and upon this account, are they active in the preſent War, ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like as that I wonder how you could without ſhame and bluſhing mention this particular, but that you ſhoot your arrows ſo at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s that you neither fear or ſhame before God or man; for thoſe you brand with the name of <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> have been and are the Inſtruments by whom God hath given a being to your ſelves and Nation; though men are blind, and do not or wil not ſee it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Are you an Enemy to the Saints, becauſe they are men of peace, and not of War and blood like your ſelves?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You diſcover much ignorance or wilfulneſs in your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of them, or elſe you could not ſo contradict your ſelf in it. In the ſeventh Tenent, you ſay, <hi>They are tumultuous, and raiſed Tumults in</hi> Germany, <hi>and filled it with the fire of Sedition, to the loſs of ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand men.</hi> And in the eighteenth, <hi>Wars are uſeleſs.</hi> Was there ever ſuch contradictions heard? And truly I muſt tell you, I credit not the Relation of the <hi>German</hi> Wars; I ſee how bold you are in lying, while we are yet alive to give you Anſwer, that I cannot credit that Relation, the people being gone, and their Adverſaries too relate it; I rather think the Prieſts were the cauſe of it, as they were in this Nation; and am confident, if they durſt give a Relation of things to another Age, They would ſay as much of the Anabaptiſts, or rather of the baptized Chriſtians of this Nation, as they of old did of thoſe in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49506:9"/>
            <p>19. <hi>That all Ordinances are legal, that the ſpirit is all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you contradict your ſelf again; if another ſhould have done ſo much, you would have thought him not in his right wits.</p>
            <p>In the firſt you ſay, <hi>Their Tenent is that none muſt be baptized un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they come to perfect age, and can make confeſſion of their Faith.</hi> Here they own baptiſm you confeſs your ſelf; And in the 26. you ſay, <hi>Their Tenent is, that after rebaptization they cannot ſin;</hi> in which you belie them as much as ever the Devil belyed Truth; but I paſs: In the 19 you ſay, <hi>They deny all Ordinances:</hi> Is not this contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Truly, you teach people not to believe you, and then you are angry with the people for it.</p>
            <p>20. <hi>The Magiſtrate muſt compell none in matters of Religion, but muſt tolerate all.</hi>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Can Magiſtrates make men Religious? Is it not the work of Chriſt to make men Chriſtians and Religious, and to compel them by the power of love? Or is it the work of the Magiſtrate? I thought where to have you at laſt; within the Borders of <hi>Rome;</hi> and indeed Sir, are you come no farther yet? What, a Miniſter of Chriſt? and want the help of the Magiſtrate to make Chriſtians, to compel them to come in unto you? And Sir, Why may not a <hi>Jeſuite</hi> have as good a Church as you, if the Magiſtrate muſt convert them, compel them to come in? and ſo you will have in all. Do you believe that its the work of God to convert? and that he will take one of a City, and two of a Tribe, and bring them to <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> How durſt you then to bring in all by a Magiſterial Power into the Church? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you reſolve to make them Hypocrites, and to damn them to the purpoſe; or unleſs you ſee it ſtand for your profit and advantage, the cloathing and feeding of your back and belly by the vulgar ſort of people, who are thus deluded by you. And as for toleration, we deſire not the Magiſtrate to tolerate any in their wickedneſs; and if any under the pretence of conſcientious principles live and allow themſelves in looſneſs, baſeneſs and prophaneſs, let the Sword of Juſtice be drawn for the execution of Juſtice, upon all ſuch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of perſon or opinion, and in it ſhall we rejoyce.</p>
            <p>21. <hi>That the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt, are not three diſtinct perſons, one in Eſſence. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Sir, Who told you they were three perſons? have you it in Scripture or by tradition from <hi>Rome?</hi> if in Scripture, produce it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49506:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> when you come forth in publick next; for mine own part, I know no ſuch Scripture. And this I ſhall with confidence affirm, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Father, Son or Spirit, are at all called Perſon or Perſons as God, but its a Title proper only to man, &amp; in Scripture given to none elſe; and therefore come from <hi>Rome.</hi> Be inſtructed now therefore ye wiſe men of the Earth, and do not judge ſo harſhly of honeſt men, becauſe they cannot believe that which is not written in Scripture, and be content to be fools, that you may be wiſe, and let theſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions return to their firſt center.</p>
            <p>23. <hi>That Chriſt hath removed the Law, and now the pure Goſpel is the only Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What yet more ignorance and malice? Is this one of the wrinkles and deformities, one of the deluſions of that deluded Sect? I wonder you have left out one; this comes very near it, that they expect ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Free grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt; Is this ſuch a ſtrange wrinkle and deluſion with you, that Chriſt hath removed the Law? I pray what was the end of his coming, if not to remove the Law as a diſpenſation held forth in the hands of <hi>Moſes? The Law came by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Joh 1. 17. Firſt, he came to fulfil the Law every jot and title of it; <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17, 18. He fulfilled all the righteouſneſs of it; for thus it becometh us to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all righteouſneſs, <hi>Mat</hi> 3. 15. and ſo is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to all thoſe who believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. Secondly, He hath removed the Curſe and condemnation of it, <hi>Gal. 3. 13. Rom.</hi> 8. 1. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He hath removed the Rule of it as in the hands of <hi>Moſes;</hi> for there it was the Rule that produced the Curſe, it was a miniſtration of death; and now the pure Goſpel is the only Rule of Saints; And is this ſuch a myſtery and deformity to you? a Miniſter of the Goſpel and ignorant of this Truth? Sir, I muſt tell you, that if you were a Chriſtian in good earneſt, you ſhould not, you could not be ignorant that the Goſpel, the Law of Chriſt, is the Rule of the Saints, <hi>Mat. 28. 20. Act.</hi> 3. 22. They are marryed to him, and ſubject to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 74. Chriſt takes all that old diſpenſation, both Moral and Ceremonial, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own hands, and is the ſubſtance of the Ceremonies and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of the Moral Law, and now gives forth the ſubſtance of the Moral again, to them, in them, not as a Rule of righteouſneſs, but as a law of love, a law of Grace, and pure Goſpel if you will have it; though you think the word <hi>pure Goſpel</hi> is reproach enough; although you cannot be litterally ignorant that the Goſpel ſignifieth glad
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49506:10"/> tydings; and is not this glad tydings think you and pure Goſpel when a ſoul comes to ſee all the wrath and enmity that was againſt him contained in Ordinances taken away? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 13, 14. and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and now there is no miniſtration of death againſt him; the Law of God is in his heart, within him, without him, a law of love and grace; no death, no wrath, nothing but love and grace, and the love of Chriſt conſtrains ſuch ſouls to yield obedience to him, and to follow him where ever he goes.</p>
            <p>But to conclude; the Thirtieth Tenent, <hi>They give a Supream and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent power in all Eccleſiaſticall cauſes and cenſures to their ſingle Congregations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And can you produce any other rule in the Goſpel then this? muſt you needs have one Church to rule over another? or rather your ſelves to rule over the whole? will nothing content you unleſs you may be Lords over Gods heritage? Sir, we allow no Synodian, nor Claſſical power, but advice and counſell we own, &amp;c. its not an Independent power neither, only independent as to man and creatures, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon Jeſus Chriſt; and if you can produce any other rule in the Goſpel, let us know it, that we may be informed: If you menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Acts</hi> 15. I ſay firſt, they ſent to Jeruſalem for advice and counſell; and ſecondly, thoſe to whom they ſent, were able infallibly to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the caſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. They could ſay, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burthens then theſe neceſſary things, &amp;c.</hi> And truly were there ſuch Apoſtles and Elders amongſt us, we ſhould gladly acknowledge them, and receive from them; but as for your Claſſicall power, we own it not, we ſubmit not to it, &amp;c. Thus have I briefly run through your Looking-glaſs; and truly it may be a Looking glaſs for your ſelf, if the Lord open your eyes to ſee into it; wherein you may firſt ſee your ignorance and blindneſs, in calling ſo many precious truths of Chriſt wrinkles and deformities, and deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the deluded Sect. And ſecondly you may ſee your malice and envy, in charging ſo many falſhoods upon them, when its your ſelves that are guilty of thoſe crimes you endeavour to faſten upon them.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſay <hi>You have given a taſte out of a full ſea, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the Anabaptiſts are no ſuch harmleſs creatures as ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</hi> A full ſea it is indeed of lyes and ſcandals on the one part; and truth ignorantly or wilfully abuſed by you on the other part: <hi>No ſuch harmleſs creatures, &amp;c.</hi> if you could by your lyes and ſcandals perſwade people to it; thus dealt the Scribes, Phariſees, and the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49506:10"/> your brethren in iniquity, with Chriſt and the Saints of old, Mat. 12 24. Joh. 8. 48. &amp; 10. 36. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 2. You commend thoſe who deſire to ſee more of their Errors, to Mr. <hi>Edwards Gangraena,</hi> and the reſt of your brethren in the ſame iniquity with you; but you do well to commend them to the <hi>Gangraena,</hi> the vileſt viper that ever appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world againſt Chriſt and his truth, and Saints; herein juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your brethren in their iniquity, and ſo drawing upon your ſelf all the righteous blood ſhed from <hi>Abel</hi> until now; you build the Tombs of the Prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, pretend high eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of them Phariſee like, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. from the 29. to the end.</p>
            <p>Well, you draw your concluſion, <hi>How needfull is it both for Church and Common-wealth to joyn the labour of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities for confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Anabaptiſts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed Sir, you had need joyn all your forces, Church, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth (that is, the Magiſtrate) Univerſities, and all for the ſuppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of truth: I wonder you had not conjured the Prince of darkneſs to your aſſiſtance in this great work and undertaking; it ſeems their errors are ſo great, ſo dangerous in your eye, as that you fear miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſome great diſaſter or change: you cry out lamentably upon their doctrine, as that it will bring deſtruction to Church, State, Souls, all.</p>
            <p>But what are their principles that are ſo full of danger?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall give ſome brief hints, 1. That Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is by grace alone through Chriſt, without any relation to any thing done by the creature.</p>
            <p>2. That this Juſtification and Salvation is enjoyed by faith.</p>
            <p>3. That this faith is the gift of God.</p>
            <p>4. That where this faith is truly wrought, it produceth an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall obedience to the whole Law of Chriſt, and that its the Believers priviledge only to be baptized.</p>
            <p>5. That obedience to Magiſtrates is the will of God, and they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit for conſcience ſake.</p>
            <p>6. That believers are to preſs forwards after perfection, in the uſe of lawfull means, as Prayer, Preaching, Conference, Fellowſhip, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>7. That none are the Miniſters of the Goſpel but ſuch as have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit, and power from on high.</p>
            <p>8. That the Spirit of Chriſt and the Scripture is ſufficient for the Miniſters calling, and both Miniſter and peoples ſalvation.</p>
            <p>9. That its the work of the Lord, and of him alone in the miniſtery of the Goſpel, to convert and build up ſouls.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:49506:11"/>
            <p>10. That all the Saints may and ought to exerciſe their gifts for the good of others, according to the meaſure they have received.</p>
            <p>11. That it is their duty to be men of peace, and as much as in them lieth, to live peaceably with all.</p>
            <p>12. That a vizard and ſhew of holineſs and innocency to deceive others, without the power and life of godlineſs, is the deepeſt hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, and ſhall be puniſhed with the deepeſt damnation.</p>
            <p>13. Their expectation is of a change in the day of the Lord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſhall be made conformable to him in glory.</p>
            <p>14. And in the mean time they are ſaved by hope, that as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of the ſoul is caſt into that which is within the vail, where they are held both ſure and ſtedfaſt.</p>
            <p>Where they are cheared and comforted againſt all the black mouths, and falſe ſcandals, and lying tongues of Devil, Prieſts, or men that ſhall be opened againſt them, notwithſtanding you fear not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tremble to do the work of the devil, in laying falſe ſcandals and accuſations to the charge of Gods Elect without juſt cauſe: the Lord will in his time reprove you, and rebuke you. Well, but I paſs by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I muſt haſten to your Arguments. I ſhall only take notice of a word or two more, becauſe its bootleſs to trace you in your folly.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>You have forborn all gall and bitterneſs, and tempered your reproof with love and meekneſs; that you have dipt your nails in oyl; that your witneſs is on high, that you have done nothing out of envie, spleen, or paſſion to the perſons of the men, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly Sir, you have buttered words, were your deeds anſwerable; when the truth is, that there is nothing elſe but gall and bitterneſs, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and falſe accuſations; are theſe words rouled in Sugar? you would fain be ſhut of them, have them baniſhed the Nation: I thought to what your ſugered words would amount at laſt; and indeed no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for it is the beſt portion that ever the world could afford the Saints.</p>
            <p>As for your enſuing preface unto your firſt Argument, I paſs it over, becauſe in anſwering your Arguments, I ſhall anſwer thoſe things which ſeem to have weight in them, becauſe reiterations are both needleſs and uſeleſs.</p>

               <head>The Arguments againſt the Preaching of gifted Brethren, Examined and Anſwered.</head>
               <div n="1" type="argument">
                  <p>Argument I. <hi>If God were angry with thoſe in the time of the Law that did uſurp the Prieſts office, then he (being Jehovah, the ſame for ever) will be angry with thoſe in the time of the Goſpel that do uſurp the Miniſters office; But God was angry with thoſe in the time of the Law that did uſurp the Prieſts office.</hi> Ergo, <hi>He will be angry with thoſe in the Gospel that do uſurp the Miniſters office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Major you ſay is clear from the immutability of Gods nature; he is the ſame, that is truth; But for to give you a diſcovery of the Fallacie, and weakneſs of your Argument; I ſhall give you a two-fold Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Your Major joyns the Prieſthood of the Law and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpel together; when the truth is, there is no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon between them; The Prieſts were to offer Sacrifice, and they only to teach the people, and to miniſter about the things of the Altar, as they were Types of Chriſt the great high Prieſt, who offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf once for all, a Sacrifice for the ſins of his people. But the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, they are no Types of Chriſt, they do not offer Sacrifice for ſin, &amp;c. Therefore there is no compariſon between them; none might meddle with the office or work of a Prieſt becauſe it was appointed of God, and did ſo clearly repreſent that great high Prieſt Chriſt Jeſus: but the work of a Miniſter of Chriſt, is to declare forth what they have heard and ſeen from the Lord Jeſus who is already come, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. 2. and this is the work of every Saint according to the meaſure of the gift received.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, I anſwer, I grant the truth of your Major in the terms; but I deny that gifted brethren uſurp the miniſterial office in their preaching; uſurpation is a ſin; but for men to ſpeak of the things of God according to the meaſure they have received, is no uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 10. 4. 11. nor ſin, but every Chriſtians duty; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you by your Logick and Retorick, and forged innovations, and abuſive Interpretations would amaze and amuze the world, and affright the Saints with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> and <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> &amp;c. But know that they are ſuch as never came from Chriſt, but the ſmoak aſcending out of the bottomleſs Pit, endeavouring to darken the bright ſhining of the Sun of righteouſneſs in and by Saints; <hi>Korah</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49506:12"/> 
                     <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> were ſmiten for doing that they were forbidden; you ſmite the Saints for doing that they are commanded, and for which they are commended, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. from the firſt to the fifth.</p>
                  <p>You apply that unto the gifted brethren, which retorts it ſelf juſtly upon your ſelf; For firſt you ſay, <hi>uſurpation to the Office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is a great ſin;</hi> gifted brethren only exerciſe their gifts, not uſurp the Office; but your ſelves it is that uſurp the Office without the gift; many, yea, moſt of the Miniſters of the Nation uſurp the Office; but for the gift, they are not only ignorant of, but enemies to it.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, not only uſurp the Office without the gift, but uſurp the Office likewiſe without any colorable ground for it; They cry up Office, Office of the Miniſtery, when they know not what it is, and have no more authentick Authority for their Ordination to their Office, then the Pope and the Devil can give them.</p>
                  <p>You inſtance <hi>Korah</hi> &amp;c. and apply it to the preaching brethen; but truly, if the Lord give you eyes but to ſee it, you might more truly apply it to your ſelves; you thruſt your ſelves into the Prieſts Office, as if you were holy and none but you, and you muſt do all and monopolize all to your ſelves, when you have no more to do with the Office of a Miniſter, nor have no more Calling to it then <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company, or the Devil himſelf.</p>
                  <p>I prove it thus: Firſt, Thoſe who uſurp the Office of the Miniſtery to themſelves, and have no more Call unto it, either according the letter or the Spirit, then <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company, are guilty of <hi>Korah</hi>'s ſin; but the Miniſtery of the Nation have no more Call unto it, then <hi>Korah</hi> had. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They are guilty of <hi>Korah</hi>'s ſin: 1. They have no Call according to the letter by a right Ordination; for that they have loſt in <hi>Rome</hi> long ſince, and now have brought forth the carkaſs, the form only, and like children bleſs themſelves with that, as if they had found ſome great pearl.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is no Call from the Spirit; they then ſhould live in the Spirits light, and not in the darkneſs of the Devil; and do the Spirits work, build up the Saints, encourage them, in exerciſing their gifts for their mutual good and building up, not hinder them and reproach them for ſo doing, bear their weakneſs, cover their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, reprove with meekneſs and love, not belye them, ſcandal them, falſly accuſe them, like the Devil. And whereas you ſay, <hi>'Tis dangerous for men to preach without a Call, and 'tis dangerous for people to bear ſuch:</hi> I ſay its truth, but gifted brethren do not preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49506:12"/> a Call, their gift and opportunity is their Call; But you it is that preach without a Call; for the gift in moſt of you, it is a ſtranger, and you are ſtrangers unto it; and believe it, the puniſhment will be great, the earth will cleave and ſwallow you up in concluſion.</p>
                  <p>To what you have added in your third Edition: I add this Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>Remember Hind,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Sir, Are you ſo impudent as to reproach Saints and Truth with particular mens ſins and faults? Might you not upon the ſame account reproach Chriſt himſelf? behold one of his own Diſciples betray him, and <hi>Peter</hi> denying him; an old trick of the Devil to reproach truth withall. If I ſhould deal thus with you, as juſtly I might, I could tell you of a zealous Preacher of your tribe, one <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Munton</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> got his ſervant with Child, and was outed by the Committee of that County; and another of <hi>Chard</hi> in the ſame County, very zealous and like your ſelf, preached bitterly againſt Sectaries; yet got one of his neareſt friends daughter with Child, and was outed likewiſe by the Committee; another very near the ſame place did the like. And upon this account, it may eaſily be made manifeſt, that there are not a filthyer Generation of Adulterers and Devils in the Nation then your own Coat.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>That for it he hath been caſt out of his gathered Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A diſcovery of their integrity; they cannot bear them that do evil, that ſay they are Jews and are not; but you entertain drunkards, whore-mongers, prophane, all ſorts in you Congregation, both of Prieſts and people, and never caſt them out; a demonſtration that you are no Church of Chriſt, but the Synagogue of Satan, a Cage of unclean and hateful birds.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="argument">
                  <p>Argument II. <hi>If none may Preach but ſuch as are ſent, then every gifted brother may not preach; but none may preach but ſuch as are ſent.</hi> Ergo. <hi>Every gifted brother may not preach.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Argument in the Minor I grant, but the Major I deny, that although its true, none can preach according to the intention of that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15 <hi>viz.</hi> for the working of faith and converting of ſouls, yet it doth not follow that every gifted brother may not preach; for every gifted brother is ſent to preach according to the meaſure of the gift received. And your grand miſtake in this Argument, is in the word <hi>ſent,</hi> whereas that word <hi>ſent,</hi> relates to the internal power of the Spirit in the Saints, by which they are enabled to ſpeak a word in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49506:13"/> ſeaſon to the very ſoul; you underſtand it to be an outward miſſion or ſending, a poor and low interpretation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The miſſion,</hi> you ſay <hi>implyes three things: Election by the Churches, Probation and Examination by the Presbytery, ſeparation by Ordination of the Presbytery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Election by the Church;</hi> But by what Church? not your Parochial Provincial or National Church; The New Teſtament ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew ſuch a Church, nor Chriſt in the New Teſtament never did, never will own ſuch a Church; a company of ignorant prophane carnal creatures, both Prieſt and people; yet have gotten the name of a Church and Miniſtery, bleſſing themſelves in that name, and yet are ignorant what it is; for a Church of Chriſt to whom Election belongs, are a company of Believers, Saints gathered out of the world by the power of the Lord in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 47. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 32. But you are Enemies to this Church, rail, reproach, perſecute; they are the object of your ſcorn and malice. I grant that where ſuch a Church is, Election belongs to them; yet I ſay, a man may be ſent to preach, though not elected by the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 1. 4. The whole Church <hi>being ſcattered preached;</hi> and I ſuppoſe none dare ſay, that all of them were Elected and Ordained: for I ſaid before, there is a preaching by way of gift and office, and preaching by gift only; and its the Churches joy to ſee her Members gifted and exerciſed in this way: But as for your ſelves, as your Church is no true Church, nor your Miniſtry no true Miniſtry: ſo you fail likewiſe in your Election by that Church; for you are in your way firſt ordained, and then you are ſent to your Churches, Pariſhes, whether they will or no, and you take them by violence, if you have a minde to their Tythes, you will be their Miniſter, though never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by them, and afterward, if you have a Call to another place for your advantage, you will leave them again, and imbrace the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the third too it may be; yet you dare be ſo bold as to tell of your electing by the Church; where as firſt, it is no Church, but a Pariſh conſiſting for the moſt part of ignorant carnal ſouls; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, you preſs your ſelves upon them whether they will or no for the moſt part; where then is your Election by the Church of Chriſt? thus you fail in the firſt part of your miſſion, non-Election by a Church of Chriſt, and then I pray who ſent you?</p>
                  <p>Your ſecond is, <hi>Probation and Examination by the Presbytery;</hi> the Scripture you produce, is, 1 Cor. 14 32. <hi>For the ſpirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets; &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>A learned interpretation of this Scripture! the ſpirits of thoſe who are to be ordained to preach, muſt be ſubject to the examination and probation of the Presbytery, when there is not the leaſt hint or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of ſuch a thing in the words; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Ye may all propheſie one by one:</hi> what, all the Presbyters? <hi>Nay all the Prophets;</hi> but who are they? <hi>All the gifted brethren:</hi> See <hi>ver,</hi> 34. none are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited but women: <hi>Let your women keep ſilence, for they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſpeak,</hi> but men are permitted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> The Lord intends Prophets only; and its ſaid in another place, 1 Cor. 12 29. <hi>Are all Apoſtles? Are all Prophets, &amp;c?</hi> The interrogation implies a negation; all are not Prophets.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. All are not Prophets.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All that have the gift of Propheſie, are Prophets, and may ſpeak, and ought to ſpeak, for the edifying of the Church, as in its place I ſhall let you ſee more at large.</p>
                  <p>Now, if all that have the gift of Prophecy, that is, to ſpeak to the edifying of the Church, may Prophecy, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. then this may occaſion confuſion, ſome may ſay, and you ſay ſo too: <hi>Nay,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the ſpirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets; For God is not the author of confuſion, but of peace, &amp;c.</hi> That is, when one Prophet, or gifted Brother hath ſpoken, and another hath any thing revealed, <hi>let the firſt hold his peace:</hi> but how can he hold his peace? the ſpirit of Prophecy is ſtrong and violent, and men cannot contain themſelves, its like fire within them? <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 25. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19, 20. to the end. But ſaith the Apoſtle, there is no ſuch thing in this propheſying, <hi>For the ſpirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets;</hi> that is, they are able to contain themſelves, and be ſilent, while another ſpeaks, &amp;c. elſe it would occaſion confuſion; <hi>But God is not the author of confuſion, but of peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the ſum of all is, That he that is a Goſpel-Prophet, can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf, and be content to hear another ſpeak as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>By all which, it appears, that a man may be ſent, and may Preach, or Propheſie, without ſuch an approbation or examination as you ſpeak of; elſe thoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. acted unlawfully in preaching without any ſuch Probation.</p>
                  <p>But to return to your ſelves, you come ſhort of any ſuch probation by the Presbytery; its true, there was a Presbytery in the primitive times; but what is that to you, who know no true Church, nor Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49506:14"/> but are enemies unto it? you have only Popiſh forms amongſt you without the power; the name of Church, Ordinances, Miniſters; but are indeed, and in truth, enemies to Church, Ordinances, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; reproach them, perſecute them, and are for the moſt part a pack of cheaters and deluders of the people for your own advantages.</p>
                  <p>I own probation by ſuch a Presbytery the Scripture ſpeaks of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore admiſſion to office, (although ſtill, I ſay, men may Preach as gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Brethren without any relation to office) but as for your Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, it was conceived in Hell, brought forth in <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet lives, and pants for breath in <hi>England,</hi> but its end is to be burned: See <hi>Eſai</hi> 65. from 11. to 16.</p>
                  <p>Your Third, in your miſſion, is, <hi>Separation by ordination of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery:</hi> which thing I own, as relating to perſons in Office, by a lawful Presbytery; yet ſtill I have two exceptions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not that Ordination to office ever did, or ſhall, where its right, prevent the gifts of the Brethren. No Sir, it was not the end for which it was appointed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You have no ſuch Presbytery; therefore no ſuch ordination; you have yours by ſucceſſion from the Pope; only you have of late altered the name from Biſhop, Prieſt and Jeſuite, to Presbyter; but the nature is not changed, as deeply ingaged, and inraged againſt the truth as any Jeſuite in <hi>Rome:</hi> and I aſſure you, I ſhould as freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Prayers and the hands of a pack of Jeſuits, as of yours, as relating to this of Ordination.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the word <hi>Sent,</hi> where, it ſeems the force of your Argument lieth, wherein you are ſo much miſtaken; you judge it to be the outward miſſion, conſiſting of <hi>Election, Probation, Ordination;</hi> whereas indeed, and truth it hath the leaſt relation to it, if any at all; my grounds are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the nature of the word and work: the word <hi>Sent</hi> in thoſe high things of God, relates to God, and his ſending immediate. So Chriſt was the <hi>Sent</hi> of the Father, to do the Fathers work: thus was <hi>Paul an Apoſtle,</hi> one <hi>ſent</hi> not of men, neither by man, but by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1. and he was ſent not to Baptize, but to Preach the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. ſo the word and work joyned together, it being a heavenly work, preaching of the Goſpel, its a heavenly ſending that is here intended.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The manner of expreſſion, the interrogation, which, as you ſay, and its granted, <hi>implies a ſtrong negation; how can he preach except he</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49506:14"/> 
                     <hi>be ſent?</hi> He cannot preach, &amp;c. that is, he cannot preach in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and power of the Lord, to the converſion and building up of ſouls, except ſent by Jeſus Chriſt in the power of the ſpirit: and if ſo ſent, he can preach, and doth preach, though all the world ſay him nay; and you being ſo much miſtaken in the truth, no wonder you have ſuch a company of Divines, as you are pleaſed to call them; all the Miniſtry of the Nation are ſent, by your account; for you have all one manner of call, and ſending, according to the outward form; if one be ſent, then all are ſent: and think you, did the Lord ever ſend forth ſuch a company to preach his Goſpel, of idle, drunken, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, proud, covetous, envious, ignorant, profane perſons, as the moſt part of them are? nay, and ſome too ſuch dunces, ſots, that all their wit cannot make a Sermon in your way of Sermon making; yet theſe have the ſame ſending with you.</p>
                  <p>And this I muſt tell you, that if God inlighten any of your profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Truth, they renounce this kind of ſending, trample it under feet, return it from whence it came: But to return, men can preach by your miſſion; but they cannot preach unleſs ſent of God to convert Souls, in the power of the internal ſending.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed to the third Argument: If this be ſuch an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward miſſion, or ſending, as you imagine, then it makes all other preaching unlawful; for its ſuch a ſending, as that there is no preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without it; how can he preach then? What the Apoſtle writ to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. <hi>You may all propheſie one by one,</hi> was unlawful; and the preaching of ſcattered brethren, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; the preaching of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9. 20. immediately after his converſion, before he was ſeparated, to the work of Miniſtry, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 2. was unlawful, and he had cauſe to repent it, if what you affirm were truth; but he rejoices in it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15, 16, 17. <hi>No ſooner was Chriſt revealed in him,</hi> but he preaches him; <hi>he went not up to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, to them that were Apoſtles before him, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to the great objection that lieth in the way againſt you, That <hi>gifting is ſending, and all gifted perſons are ſent, &amp;c.</hi> And know this will yet lie in your way, and is not ſo eaſily removed as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: you pretend a diſtinction between gifting and ſending.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Many thouſands in the Nation are gifted</hi> (you ſay) <hi>but may not dare not preach, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your gifted brethren (it ſeems) may not, dare not preach; you keep them in ſubjection; but your ſent ones, though no gift at all,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49506:15"/> they may and dare to do it, or abuſe it; and what account will you give to the Lord for this at laſt think you?</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>None may preach in a conſtituted Church without ſending,</hi> in your way: And yet in the conſtituted Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> they might all, <hi>(viz.)</hi> who had the gift, <hi>propheſy one by one;</hi> you inſtance <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> Act. 13. 1. 2. <hi>who though they had gifts muſt be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained:</hi> Yet <hi>Saul</hi> preached, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 20, 21, 22. before he was ordained, or had ſeen the Apoſtles; ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. And when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were Ordained, it was not to preach in a conſtituted Church, but to the world as you may ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>If bare gifts be a ſufficient Call, &amp;c. Then gifted boys may preach as the little gifted Boy at</hi> Stafford.</p>
                  <p>And why not Sir? will you limit the holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and dare you reproach the Scripture, as you do? <hi>out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings, he ordained ſtrength,</hi> and will confound his foes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then gifted women may preach,</hi> you ſay: This is your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; becauſe we ſay, as the Scripture ſaith, that gifted brethen may preach or propheſie; therefore you in reproach will conclude that <hi>gifted women may preach;</hi> but its your concluſion, and to your ſelf I leave it; and according to the Myſtery of the truth, I think there are but few, if any, beſides women preachers among your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>You produce, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 1. 5. Which you ſay, <hi>fully clears the ſcruple, where Chriſt diſtinguiſheth gifting men from Authoritative ſending,</hi> v. 1. <hi>he gifts them;</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>he ſends them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer: Firſt, Is this ſuch a ſending as you have talked of in your miſſion, Election, Probation, Ordination? or an immediate ſending, as he ſent <hi>Paul</hi> before he was Ordained? Here is not a word of Ordination, but ſending; no laying on of the hands of Chriſt, but gifting, ſending; and ſo the gifting and ſending of the gifted brethren, is when the Lord enables them in a meaſure unto it, and ſaith in them, to them, <hi>go,</hi> as in <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1. 16. As for thoſe gifts you mention, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 1. I query, if you or any of your ſent Brethren have thoſe gifts, or if you are ſo ſent as thoſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>You conclude two things, that muſt concur in making a Miniſter, <hi>gifts, abilities, qualifications both of life and learning;</hi> This if rightly underſtood, is a truth, and I freely own it.</p>
                  <p>But you ſeem, <hi>pag.</hi> 12. to bring in a mixture, a hodge podge, <hi>Arts, Sciences, Latine, Greek, Hebrew,</hi> &amp;c. And is it true indeed, that theſe gifts are required in a Miniſter? then no Miniſter without
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49506:15"/> them. I wonder then the Apoſtles could be Miniſters, who are ſaid to be illiterate or unlearned men, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 13. Or were they made partakers of the Spirit of Chriſt? and are not the Saints now? yea; or elſe they are none of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 9. and is not the ſame Spirit ſufficient now as then? yea certainly, to thoſe who truſt in him; but its the ſpirit of Antichriſt that ſeeks out after humane helps to ſupply the room or want of this Spirit of Chriſt; and having gotten it, they grow proud of it, are ſelf-conceited in it, make it their great idol, and dare reproach the Spirit and power of the Lord appearing in his Saints.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He muſt have power and Authority from the Presbytery to exerciſe his Gifts: he muſt not run before he be ſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have Anſwered this already: what <hi>Presbytery</hi> ſent <hi>Paul</hi> when he preached? <hi>Act.</hi> 9. or the ſcattered brethren? <hi>Act.</hi> 8. &amp;c. And where is that <hi>Presbytery</hi> among you, that have power thus to ſend? It ſeems you have high eſteem of your <hi>Presbytery:</hi> elſe you would not mention it ſo often, when its but a new trick of the Devil to give another name when the Prelate was out of date; Alas you were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of <hi>Presbytery</hi> your ſelves not long ſince: but now the name lifts you up to Heaven, although the nature of the Prelate ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. I ſuppoſe you harp ſo much upon this ſtring, that ſo they might preach nothing but what you approve, and then your dark kingdom might it may be ſtand the longer; but the Lord Jeſus will conſume and deſtroy Antichriſt, <hi>with the ſpirit of his mouth, and the brightneſs of his coming.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>All Preachers are ſent either by God, or by the Devil &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this we fully aſſent without <hi>Tertullian</hi> your witneſs; and I pray you look you unto it; Are thoſe who miniſter according to the meaſure of the gift given them, in your account, <hi>intruders, uſurpers, ſent of the Devil, or of God?</hi> Look to your ſelf man (you are upon a very ſharp point and keen rock) leſt you fall, or be ſplit before you are aware; Therefore I beſeech you take a little view, who are likelieſt to be ſent from God or the Devil, your ſelves or your gifted Brethren: The gifted brethren exerciſe the gift they have received, either firſt, when occaſion and opportunity is offered to inform the judgement in the Goſpel of Grace and Truth, that ſo, if the Lord work, ſouls may be enlightned and converted: or ſecondly, to build up the Church <hi>in its moſt holy Faith;</hi> he doth his Office as a member in the body, that it may <hi>grow up in him who is the Head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49506:16"/>
                  <p>Your ſelves, Firſt, make up a Church, a body, as you call it, of Chriſt, a monſtrous body of prophane ones, and give them Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, tell them they are Chriſtians, and ſo delude them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infinite mercy damn them for ever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Are ignorant of, and envious to the truth, the Saints and Servants of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Do not the work of Chriſt, preach, baptize Believers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, gather Churches, build up Saints, but the contrary by way of oppoſition to all.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, For the moſt part are carnal, looſe, baſe in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not ſo much as common civility or civil honeſty; yet all one ſending.</p>
                  <p>Now be your ſelves judges who are ſent from God, and who from the Devil; who doth the work of Chriſt, and who the work of the Devil. <hi>Oh conſider this you who forget God, leſt he come and tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pag. 13. You ſay, <hi>'Tis for Wolves and falſe Prophets to be ſelf called, and to come of their own accord &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> You ſay truth. They are wolves who are Self-called, <hi>Thieves and Robbers Joh.</hi> 10. you mention it; but the Query lieth here ſtill, Who are the Self-called ones, you or the preaching brethren? And ſo, who are the wolves, you or them? Gifted brethren they preach only by Gift as they have received, as I ſaid, either for converſion or building, that they might inform others in the ſame truth they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are informed, or comfort others <hi>with the ſame comfort they themſelves are comforted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you, who boaſt ſo much of your ſending, you come indeed and are not ſent; for firſt, you <hi>come not in at the door, but in at the window;</hi> the door is Chriſt and his Spirit, and there is no other door that admits to preaching; ſee 1 <hi>Cor. 12. there are many Gifts and Works and operations; but ſtill the ſame ſpirit who worketh all in all.</hi> But you have found out another way, your Popiſh Ordination; and none muſt preach but ſuch, juſt as the Pope and the Prelates; ſo your ſelves walk in the ſame ſteps; you are the Theives and Robbers that climb in at the window or ſome other way; a hole you have made for your ſelves to creep in at: and ſecondly, the end of your coming in, is to ſteal, rob and to carry away to enrich your ſelves with the worldly gain, the fat Tythes of the peoples labors and encreaſe: but thoſe who come in by the door Chriſt, they dare not do it, nay they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49506:16"/> dare not but like honeſt and true men, diſery and diſcover the thief and the robber, that ſo he may be known and avoided.</p>
                  <p>And as for Wolves, who are they but ſuch a devour the ſheep? <hi>I ſend you forth</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>as Lambs among Wolves;</hi> its the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Wolves to devour the Lambs; how have the Popiſh Wolves devoured? let Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies witneſs; Epiſcopall Wolves? let the Prelates daies witneſs; Presbyterian Wolves? let latter times; if they could have prevailed, they would have ſuckt the blood of almoſt all the Lambs of Jeſus Chriſt in this Nation ere this. Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly you may account us Wolves, becauſe in word and writing we diſcover your baſeneſs and unrighteous waies: be not miſtaken Sir, Light cannot but diſcover Darkneſs: but there is no ſpirit or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of perſecution in us, we deſire not the Magiſtrate to meddle with you, or to hinder you from preaching, if you turn not Traytors to the State; the Wolves it is that bite and devour, that make the Lambs their prey; but the Lambs are meek, patient, ſuffering, not biting and devouring, &amp;c. But ſtay awhile, go not off triumphing; If what you ſay be truth, That the gifted brother was <hi>ſilent at this Argument;</hi> yet believe it, it was not the light that ſhined in it that overcame him, but your cunning ſophiſtry in reaſoning: but believe it, your own Argument will burn up all your <hi>ſending</hi> in concluſion, and then you ſhall conſeſs that gifted brethren may preach the Goſpel. You ſay <hi>Goliah fled;</hi> but you are miſtaken; I ſuppoſe rather it was little <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> and at preſent great <hi>Goliah</hi> gets the victory, <hi>Goliah</hi> with his Armor of proof, Univerſity ſtuff, &amp;c. but <hi>Goliah</hi> muſt be routed in the end.</p>

               <div n="3" type="argument">
                  <head>Now to your third Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If all that have gifts may preach, then all that have gifts may baptize; but all that have gifts</hi> (ſay you) <hi>may preach;</hi> ergo, <hi>all that have gifts may baptize.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In my anſwer to this Argument, I ſhall paſs by what the gifted bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren anſwered, as you make mention with ſo much reproach and ſcorn, as if you had ſate a long time in Scorners chair: for mine own particular, I grant the truth of your Argument; That gifted brethren may preach, and may baptize, and give the Supper too; and that I have to do, is to make good this principle, which I doubt not but I ſhall with much light and evidence of Truth; and then this Argument
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49506:17"/> is routed, and blown away with the wind of truth, as the morning dew before the Sun.</p>
                  <p>My Arguments are theſe: Firſt <hi>John,</hi> the firſt preacher of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and baptizer in the water, to the waſhing away of ſin by the blood of Chriſt, yet had no ſpeciall miſſion nor did any miracle, <hi>John</hi> 10. 41. but by divine inſpiration, according to the meaſure he had received, ſo he preached, and ſo he baptized; its true he was propheſied of before, and ſent in a ſpeciall manner to prepare the way of the Lord, &amp;c. yet he did his work in an ordinary way, as a gifted brother, if you will have it ſo, not extraordinarily gifted and ſent. See <hi>John</hi> 1. 31. he preached Chriſt, and baptized into his name, and knew him not; like many an honeſt ſoul, that are ſpeaking of Chriſt, and preach of him too, when they have but ſhattered and ſhallow ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of him, there being ſuch a worth in him, that a ſoul that hath had but a ſight of him, and an intereſt in him, cannot but declare him, as the woman of <hi>Samaria. John</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ground is from <hi>John</hi> 4. 1, 2. The Diſciples of Chriſt then were the ordinary Chriſtians, the alone Church of the Goſpel, Chriſt the Head, Paſtor, and Shepherd; yet it is ſaid that <hi>Chriſt bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed not, but his Diſciples;</hi> compare this Scripture with <hi>Act.</hi> 10. to the latter end, <hi>Peter commanded them to be baptized;</hi> not that he did it himſelf, but commanded them; and its very probable that there were ſome gifted preaching brethren with him who did the work; and the like aſſiſtance might he expect when the 3000 were converted and added to the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>The ſcattered brethren went preaching the Goſpel;</hi> and Chap. 11. <hi>The hand of the Lord was with them and a great number believed and turned to the Lord;</hi> and the ſame who converted them, baptized them, if they were at all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, for they gathered them into Church-fellowſhip. <hi>But the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles hearing of it, ſent Barnabas to confirm and ſtrengthen them,</hi> which he did, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. not baptize them: Thus it appears that preaching Diſciples may baptize, not that they muſt: <hi>Paul was ſent, not to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, but to preach;</hi> yet ſeeing he was ſent to do the greater, he might do the leſſer, and did it too.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>This is that will breed confuſion in the Church; no need of Officers, if any gifted brother may adminiſter Ordinances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Which ſhall be my third Argument too; That Officers, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Teachers are not for the being of the Church and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; they are both before them, and without them; but they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49506:17"/> for the wel-being of the Church; there is nothing to be done in the Church, no Ordinance to be adminiſtred, but a gifted brother may do it, with the approbation of the Church; but becauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency and order, therefore ſome men are choſen forth to act in behalf of the whole, for the good of the whole; not that ſuch men thus choſen ſhould uſurp ſuch power and authority to themſelves, as to ſet up themſelves above all, and ſtifle the grace and workings of the Spirit in others; its time then to dethrone them again; and the work of a Paſtor or Teacher doth not conſiſt all in preaching and baptizing, as Prieſts now adaies think, but in knowing the ſtate of the flock, <hi>in watching, in reproving, in admoniſhing, in rebuking with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in the Spirit and power of the Lord:</hi> There is no one thing that I know belongs to a Paſtor, but a gifted brother may do it; it is his duty when time, opportunity and liberty cals for it; only the brother doth it according to his gift, as a member; the other waiting on his office, as one entruſted by the Church more then ordinary for that end.</p>
                  <p>It is with the Church in this caſe, as with a body Politique that needs Magiſtrates and Officers: not for its being, but for its wel-being; its not Magiſtracy that gives a being to a People, but a People gives a being to the Magiſtracy: and the Magiſtracie is or ſhould be for the Peoples good. So it is in this caſe with the Church; its not the Paſtor that gives being to the Church, but the Church gives being to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor; the Church and Ordinances are before Paſtors.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But there muſt be ſome one or other to preach for the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church, and ſuch a one is before the Church, and may be ſaid to give being to the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, but we are not now ſpeaking about preaching out of, but in a conſtituted Church. And ſecondly, out of a conſtituted Church gifted brethren may preach for the gathering of a Church or Churches; and if God give a bleſſing to them, and manifeſt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with them, as thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> 8. with <hi>Acts</hi> 11. they may baptize them, and gather them into fellowſhip, as they did.</p>
                  <p>You pretend abſurdities that will follow: <hi>If men may preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a call, they may baptize, deliver the Supper, exerciſe Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures without a Call.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay it is not without a cal: the Churches freedom or deſire is cal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough for either, if the party be gifted to it; all lawful Cals to preach, either w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>in or without, are ſutable to the gift. If no gift, the cal is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49506:18"/> and that Church which hath power to call an Officer, hath power to call forth any gifted brother to do ſervice for the Church, if he have a freedom within himſelf to do it.</p>
                  <p>But you ſay, <hi>then gifted boyes, and gifted women, and gifted Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives may preach, if all gifted perſons may preach:</hi> But by the way, pray Sir, what is the difference between women and midwives? you might have done well to diſtinguiſh; for I thought midwives had been women all this while; but I have told you already that there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between gifted brethren, and gifted women; that is your own nonſenſicall concluſion, <hi>becauſe gifted men may preach, therefore gifted women.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Should I give by way of conceſſion, though not grant, That its not lawfull for men out of office to baptize: yet they may preach; and that 1. From the command; for its not the reaſoning from the greater to the leſs will ſerve you, but its the command that makes things lawfull, or unlawfull; there is a command of preaching, if not of baptizing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3, 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. Examples, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 4. and 9. 20. and 18. 26.</p>
                  <p>2. Preaching and Baptiſm were not ſo united together, as never to be ſeparated (as you pretend) See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="argument">
                  <head>But to your fourth Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If no Prieſt or Prophet might offer Sacrifice under the Law without a Call, then none may preach the Word, or deliver the Sacraments under the Goſpel without a Call; but no man might offer Sacrifice under the Law without a Call.</hi> Ergo, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This Argument is one in ſubſtance with your firſt: I thought your Univerſity Divinity had delivered you from ſuch Tautologies; and although I ſuppoſe there is enough ſaid in mine Anſwer to the firſt for ſatisfaction to both, yet I ſhall follow you in this likewiſe, that ſo I may not leave one ſtone unturned, nor any part of your warlike frame uncharged, that ſo your Pulpit-Guard may be wholly and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally routed. And to your Argument I give you a treble Anſwer;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that there is no compariſon to be made between the Jewiſh Prieſts, and the Miniſters of the Goſpel, although indeed your ſelves in many things run parallel with them; but this I have anſwered to your firſt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Secondly, I anſwer, that its not the parity of Jewiſh
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49506:18"/> Prieſts and Miniſters of the Goſpel that will hold in your Argument; that is nonſenſicall like moſt of the reſt; becauſe the Jewiſh Prieſt or Prophet in time of the Law only might offer Sacrifice, therefore none may preach or miniſter Ordinances under the Goſpel without a Call; you may as well make this Argument, Becauſe none were circumciſed under the Law but men children, therefore none under the Goſpel but men children muſt be baptized; But Sir, the limiting of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Sacrifice to the Legal Prieſthood, is no ground why none but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in office ſhould preach; it was ſufficient to them, that none but them ſhould offer Sacrifice. So under the Goſpel, the command of Chriſt is the rule of Saints, and that is it that makes things lawfull or unlawfull: the Lord will have his ſervants not to hide their talents, but that which they hear in ſecret, they ſhall proclaim upon the houſe top, that is publiquely, &amp; not to hide as by ſtealth his goodneſs within them; and this which you for baſe and ſelf-ends ſo much cry out againſt, was never forbidden, but ever approved both in the old and new Teſtament; any ſervant of the Lord might and did propheſie and preach forth the goodneſs of the Lord to others; <hi>Moſes</hi> wiſheth that <hi>all the Lords people were Prophets:</hi> And the Propet <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 145. 10, 11, 12. ſpeaks once for all both for Law and Goſpel, <hi>All thy works ſhall praiſe thee O Lord, and thy Saints ſhall bleſs thee; they ſhall ſpeak of the glory of thy Kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the ſons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majeſty of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> Note man, its the Saints work and priviledge to declare the glorious majeſty of the Kingdom of Chriſt: And why? Becauſe they have been in the Kingdom, and have ſeen it, and can ſpeak of it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11. You are miſtaken man, its not your Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, nor your Call, that teacheth you knowledge in the Kingdom of the Lord; and that is the reaſon of your ſo deep ignorance of, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt the Truth; but its the Saints work to preach <hi>the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Kingdom:</hi> The Goſpel is called <hi>The word of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> Mat. 13. 19. And who ſhall preach the word of the Kingdom? Why, <hi>the Saints ſhall declare the glorious word of thy Kingdom, and talk of thy power;</hi> and hence it is that the ſame Prophet <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 68. 11. ſaith, <hi>The Lord gave the word, and great was the company of thoſe that publiſhed it,</hi> or <hi>the army,</hi> as the Margin notes it; In the Hebrew <hi>A great Army of Saints,</hi> publiſhing the Truth; believe it Sir, you are miſtaken, to imagine that God hath given a Patent to any Society or Generation of men under the Sun, of what name or title
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49506:19"/> ſoever they dignifie, or diſtinguiſh themſelves, whether Pope, Cardinal, Jeſuite, Biſhop, Prieſt, or Presbyter, that ſo they might monopolize Preaching to themſelves; ſo making that a trade <hi>cum Privilegio,</hi> which is proper, and in common to the Saints, according as God ſhall reveal unto them: where the Lord ſpeaks the word, there will be Preachers: And truly Sir, you endeavour what you can to make the Saints to come ſhort of other Creatures; the whole Creation in their ſpheres, and places, all ſet forth the praiſe of their Maker; and ſhall not the Saints, ſutably to their ſphears, capacities, and underſtandings, do the like? <hi>Thy works ſhall praiſe thee, O God, and thy Saints ſhall not be behind</hi> the whole Creation, <hi>they ſhall bleſs thee,</hi> they ſhall talk of thee, they ſhall declare thee to the ſons of men, &amp;c. But</p>
                  <p>3. I anſwer, that all the Saints are a ſpiritual, and a holy <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 5. and their Prieſtly Office under the Law had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation at all to yours under the Goſpel, or any other officiating mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; for that Prieſthood was 1. A Type of Chriſt; and 2. Of the Church of Chriſt &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>4. I anſwer, and conclude, That Gifted Brethren do not preach without a Call, as none might ſacrifice without a Call, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you ſay, and give it as your reaſon, That <hi>Preaching is a greater work then offering ſacrifice;</hi> I ſay its not the greatneſs of the work, but the will of the Lord commanding the work, that makes the thing either lawful, or unlawful: whereas you make ſo many reiterations of a Call; and that <hi>many creep in at the window, &amp;c.</hi> I have ſaid enough to this already, and proved it ſo, that your ſelves are the men, though you ſee it not, and not the Gifted Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, That <hi>a true Miniſter preacheth in Gods Name by vertue of a Call, &amp;c.</hi> And to this purpoſe you mention <hi>Paul who often ſpeaks of his Call.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, firſt, That he never mentions his Call to ſuch a baſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly end, as you ſo often mention yours, <hi>viz.</hi> that you might ſtop, and ſilence the workings, and the gifts of the Spirit in all, except in you ſelves, where it is not neither, but Univerſity Gifts inſtead of the Spirit; a Myſtery of Iniquity.</p>
                  <p>2. If his Call had been no better then yours, he might, and would have been aſhamed of it, rather then to have boaſted as you do: but believe me, your glorying is not good; your glory will be your ſhame in the end.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49506:19"/>
                  <p>But to your Reaſons, to convince men of the neceſſity of a Call to this Sacred Function; yours is a ſacred one in deed, as ſacred as the holy Chair of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant it for truth; that is the reaſon that all your Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are null; your Preaching null; for you preach people into an outward formality without power: Hence it is, that the work of the Sent-preaching Brethren is to undo what you have done: And this I can aſſure you, that it would be much eaſier, in an ordinary way, to convert Souls to Chriſt amongſt Indians and Heathens, then in <hi>England:</hi> you, their teachers, have ſo rivited them in the ways of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and formality; the leaders of the people have cauſed them to Erre.</p>

                  <p>As there are diverſities of Members, yet the ſame Body.</p>
                  <p>And ſo 3. Diverſities of Callings; <hi>ſome Apoſtles,</hi> that is ſent for the gathering of Churches; <hi>ſome Prophets,</hi> gifted brethren in the Church, exerciſing for the <hi>edifying of the Body of Chriſt; Paſtors and Teachers</hi> for to feed and watch; yet not to hinder, but rather to further, and incourage the Prophets; Deacons to ſee to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the poor, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, or may ſee, that this order is ſo far from making a Monſter, that it ſets every member to do his office in his place, every one to exerciſe his Gift in the Body, according to the meaſure he hath received.</p>
                  <p>But you it is who make a monſter in all its parts; a filthy corrupt leprous body, without, or at beſt, with rotten, falſe, painted, arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial members, leggs, arms, &amp;c. without a head. Jeſus Chriſt never was, never will be Head to ſuch a Body; and your are the men, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters that form up, and preſent him with ſuch a body, and then cry
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49506:21"/> it up, boaſting of this Body, dance about this ill-favoured Calf, and cry out againſt the true Churches to be monſtrous Bodies, when your ſelves are the Monſters all the while.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>If this be tolerated, it will make both Miniſtry and Miniſters contemptible, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I thought where I ſhould take you at laſt: Oh, you love Honour as well as your Profit, to have the cap and knee, and to be called of men <hi>Rabbi;</hi> then it goes gallant; and pleaſeth the heart of a proud Phariſee: but you are miſtaken; this is not the way to make Miniſters vile, but the alone way for them to be eſteemed of as the Miniſters of Chriſt, when they walk according to the Truth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour not the dethroning of any to exalt themſelves: and this is that hath made you diſhonourable in the eyes of Chriſtians, your pride and vileneſs in this particular.</p>
                  <p>You ſay <hi>The toleration of ſuch irregularities is not ſo ſmall an error as ſome imagine, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alas Sir, do you want the power of the Civil Magiſtrate, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt you into the throne? it ſeems it matters not what becomes of Souls; let them be ignorant, let them ſink, let them periſh, ſo your Honour may be upheld, you care not, &amp;c. You'l make it a matter of conſideration and concernment to the Civil Magiſtrate, to oppoſe the way and Truth of Chriſt for your own ſelf ends and intereſts.</p>

                     <hi>Every Preacher muſt be able in ſome good meaſure above ordinary Chriſtians, not only to divide the Word aright,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 15. <hi>Soundly to interpret, and give the true ſence and meaning, applying the ſame to edification; but he muſt be able alſo to convince gain-ſayers,</hi> Tit. 1 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But every Gifted Trades-man, Nailer, Taylor, &amp;c. is not able to divide the Word aright, nor to convince a learned adverſary, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayer.</hi> Ergo.</p>
                  <p>The Major, you ſay, <hi>is clear of it ſelf;</hi> the Minor you pretend to prove, which I deny: your proof is this,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe who want learning, both Humane and Divine, cannot be ſound Interpreters, nor ſolid Diſputants, but moſt of our Gifted artificers want learning, both Humane and Divine.</hi> Ergo.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I queſtion what you intend by Learning, Humane and Divine, whether you minde a perfection of Learning; for you ſet no bounds upon your terms; if ſo, its to be doubted that your ſelves are but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49506:22"/> Ignoramuſ's in both, in your beſt and moſt experienced Art of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; you come ſhort of many Heathens and Philoſophers; and I am very confident that many in this Nation who never knew what an Art or Science meant in its form or method in way of School Study, have more natural Philoſophy, Logick, Retorick in their heads then your ſelves, who ſo much pride your ſelves in your ſhame.</p>
                  <p>But whether am I wandring into the bottomleſs Pit of mans wiſdom? take your honour in this blackneſs and darkneſs, and go on ſpoiling ſouls by your Philoſophy, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8. till the Lord prevent you.</p>
                  <p>You ſay in the Minor of your firſt Argument, <hi>That every gifted Tradeſ-man, nailer, tailor, &amp;c. is not able to divide the word aright, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And is every Prieſt of your Calling in the Nation able to divide the Word aright in your own judgement? or is one in ten, nay in twenty? be the judge your ſelf; if not, be aſhamed to bring ſuch Arguments any more, becauſe every gifted Tradeſ-man is not able, therefore none are able, &amp;c. becauſe every Prieſt is not able, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none are able Artificers in their art of preaching.</p>
                  <p>And in your ſecond Argument, you ſay, <hi>moſt of them want learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And may not your ſelves ſay moſt of your own Calling want learning humane and divine? I am ſure you want divine learning; elſe you would not make ſuch humane Arguments againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth; but we confeſs your Argument, we want learning, not humane but divine, and we wait on the Lord for his teachings, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging with the Apoſtle, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things? 2 Cor.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>Nor to convince a learned Adverſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truly, now adays your ſelves are the learned Adverſaries the Church of Chriſt hath to deal withall: And this I muſt tell you, and you'l finde it by experience, that the gifted brethren will in the light and ſtrength of truth, overturn all the wiſdom of the fleſh, as its exerciſed againſt the truth, in you or any others; God will make all fleſhes wiſdom and pride and glory vale it ſelf, and fall down at the preſence of his truth in his Saints, as <hi>Dagon before the Ark;</hi> you are miſtaken Sir, to think its your humanity that makes you able to divide the Word aright, and that makes you an able Diſputant; its the power of the Spirit of Chriſt in his people that makes them able
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49506:22"/> 
                     <hi>to divide the Word, and to convince gain-ſayers;</hi> Therefore your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is weak, and hath nothing in it: if any thing, it reacheth your ſelves as well as others, nay more then others; becauſe you live in that ſphear, and yet want; but the gifted brethren ſee their wants, and acknowledge it, not boaſt of their fulneſs like your ſelves; and they ſee they may want learning both humane and divine, and yet divide the Word aright, be ſolid Diſputants for the truth, ſo far as they have received, not walking without or beyond their line; knowing the Lord is their light and ſtrength, <hi>who never fails thoſe that truſt in him;</hi> and only one thing I deſire to Query of you, If ever the like was read or heard of in Scripture, ſo much ado about humane Learning, to beat down truth, and prevent the free opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit in Saints; Did any ſeek to hinder Gods workings in this way? Oh Sir, you want learning, humane Arts and parts, Therefore propheſy not, preach not unto us: If Old or New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, Law or Goſpel, <hi>Moſes</hi> or Chriſt hath done the like, pray produce it; If not, be aſhamed for ever to account your ſelf a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpel, and to mak uſe of ſuch an engine againſt truth and its Owners, as never any in the world made uſe of but <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You grant, That <hi>Tranſlations are excellent helps; yet there is ſuch an emphaſis and fulneſs in the Original, that the Tranſlation is nothing to the glory of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its like that is the reaſon you are ſo filled and puffed up with this outward fulneſs, as that the Original of all fulneſs, the fulneſs of the Spirit is ſcarce ever ſpoken of by you, as if the Spirit of the Lord was not ſufficient for theſe things.</p>
                  <p>You complain, <hi>What miſerable wrakings and rentings of Texts have come into the world for want of this Learning!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Come Sir, Let us now a little conſider, who are the greateſt wrackers, renters, and tearers of Scriptures; The learned Humaniſts, or the preaching Brethren.</p>
                  <p>The preaching brethren, they hold and ſay, that ſalvation is through Grace, and that without any relation to any qualification or good in the creature according to <hi>Iſay 55. 1. Rom.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
                  <p>The Humaniſts ſay, no; but there muſt be ſome creature qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſome good in the creature before the ſoul muſt preſume to come to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The preaching brethren hold and ſay, that none but believers are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49506:23"/> to be baptized, becauſe there is neither precept nor preſident for it.</p>
                  <p>The Humaniſts ſay, Infants muſt, though no Scripture for it, and this is their practice.</p>
                  <p>The preaching brethren ſay, That the Saints are the Church of Chriſt, and that they dare not own any elſe to be members, if they manifeſt the contrary, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 12. becauſe they are the body of Chriſt,</hi> chap. 12. 27. <hi>and compact together,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 16. with carnal ones they can have no ſpiritual fellowſhip, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. 16.</p>
                  <p>But the Humaniſts ſay nay to this; They will turn the world into Church, and make all Chriſtians, thus deluding them, thus forming up a monſtrous body for Chriſt, if he would accept of it: But you might with better acceptation preſent your Church at the feet of the Pope then at the feet of Chriſt: Thus owning a communion with them rather in their Eſtates, tythe Pigs, Geeſe and Eggs, then with their ſouls; for ſome of you will confeſs, they are no Chriſtians but deluded ones, for ſelf-ends, and would not own them, nor have any fellowſhip with them, were it not for their bellies; <hi>their God is their belly, and their glory will be their ſhame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The preaching brethren, they own none for Chriſtians but thoſe who are convinced and converted by the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>The Humaniſts want the power of the Civil Magiſtrate to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert ſouls for them.</p>
                  <p>The preaching brethren, they ſay, That Chriſt is King of Saints, and that its his work alone, to accept or reject in matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, relating to the knowledge or worſhip of him; and that who ſo gets into his room is the Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>But the Humaniſts, Pope-like, and Queen <hi>Mary</hi>-like, cry out, impriſon, hang, burn, baniſh the Sectaries that will not do as we ſay &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The preaching brethren ſay, That preaching is a Gift, and that its the work of the Saints according to their meaſure to communicate, having received freely, freely to give.</p>
                  <p>But the Humaniſts ſay nay to this; It is an Art and a Trade, and by this we have our gain, it coſt us much the attaining; therefore we muſt ſell, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The preaching brethren ſay, That where the love of Chriſt is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, its a law ſufficient to keep from ſin and to conform to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But the Humaniſts ſay, nay, its a Doctrine of liberty; and that its the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> fear and wrath that muſt keep from ſin, &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49506:23"/>
                  <p>Thus have I given ſome few brief hints amongſt many that ſo it may appear who are the renters of Scripture, the gifted brethren or the Linguiſts.</p>
                  <p>You Query, <hi>How a man ſhould expound and reconcile Scripture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out learning:</hi> To that end, you produce many Scriptures, you ſay, <hi>hard to be interpreted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer: That the Spirit of Chriſt, which is the original of all truth, and dwelleth in the Saints, is ſufficient, and doth teach them thoſe things of which the Humaniſts are ignorant, <hi>Joh. 15. 13. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. from the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the end. You conclude, there is <hi>need of Retorick and Arts to underſtand the Scripture.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 19. <hi>quench not the Spirit;</hi> that is, the Gifts; and yet notwithſtanding all your Retorick, Arts, Learning, &amp;c. you are the men that underſtand not the Scripture; you are the men who quench the Spirit in your brethren; and deſpiſe Propheſying, if it comes not out of your forge; for that is it which is there intended; <hi>quench not the Spirit;</hi> that is, the Spirits workings in the Saints, which many will do out of a low and baſe eſteem of their brethren, in deſpiſing of Propheſy, which is but an interpretation of the former. How do men quench the Spirit?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In deſpiſing of Propheſy, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence the holy Ghoſt,</hi> you ſay, <hi>commends learning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the way; holy Ghoſt, and for all your learning is there any ſuch word in all the Scripture as Ghoſt?</p>
                  <p>But you inſtance in <hi>Moſes, Act. 7. 22. Who was learned in all the wiſdom of the Egyptians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And no wonder, being naturalized unto it, bred up in it. <hi>Daniel</hi> and his companions had skill <hi>in all learning and wiſdom,</hi> Dan. 1. 4. 17. For what was it theſe children were to be looked forth? that in it they might preach, or to teach the tongues and learning of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> to thoſe amongſt whom they were Captives? <hi>verſ. 17. God gave them underſtanding in all learning and wiſdom, and to</hi> Daniel <hi>the knowledge of viſions.</hi> This was the gift of God immediate, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Arts, that they might ſet forth the glory of their Creator, not themſelves and their own pride. <hi>Apollo was eloquent and mighty in Scripture;</hi> So are your gifted brethren, able in the might and ſtrength of the grace of Chriſt, to hold forth truth, and to convince gain-ſayers, though not mighty in humane Arts, &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> could ſpeak <hi>languages more then they all;</hi> but what languages? acquired, got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by induſtry, or of the Spirit? its the gifts of the Spirit the Apoſtle
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49506:24"/> ſpeaks of, not humane; this is but a trick and ſhift of the Devil and Antichriſt, now they have loſt thoſe gifts of the Spirit, to ſet up humane in the room; a myſtery of iniquity.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>The Apoſtle cites Heathen Poets to convince the Grecians,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>So may the gifted brethren produce Turks and Heathens to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove you and your Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He uſeth Syriack and Hebrew phraſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No wonder, when it was his own native Language.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence we read,</hi> ſay you, <hi>of Schools of the Prophets and Colledges erected &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is but your own Learned Retorical Expoſition; there is never a word of School or Colledge in the Text, but the ſons of the Prophets, that is, every one who had received the ſame ſpirit of the Prophets; if there were Schools and Colledges as you imagine, its like the Lord dealt with them as he doth with you now adays; he never that we read of took a Prophet from that School, but from their Callings, that the work might appear to be of himſelf, and and not man; but the truth is, there were no ſuch Schools of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wantonneſs as you have erected for your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Well ſay you, <hi>But how ſhall a man be able to preſerve the truth? how ſhall a man be able to Analyſe, and open Scripture without Logick, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, Tongues, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And do you not know in good earneſt how to do it? Is your Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy the mother of your Theologie? Your gifted brethren can tell you how to do it; its the light of the Spirit of truth in which they preſerve truth; and its in the light of the ſame Spirit in which they underſtand and open obſcure and dark phraſes. And indeed, as you ſay, Great is the pride and wantonneſs of the Prieſts, to tread all that learning of the Spirit under foot, without which the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Scriptures is not to be had, laying all upon humane en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, undervaluing the Gifts of the Spirit, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But you conclude your ſelf, <hi>That Arts and Sciences are neceſſary, not of abſolute neceſſity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, Sir, To ſay no more about this Argument, your gifted brethren, they ſtick to that which is of abſolute neceſſity, the Spirit of Chriſt. You bleſs your ſelves with that you confeſs is not of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity; a man may be a Miniſter without it; make you much of it, little good wil it do you, and little will it avail you in the evil day.</p>

                     <hi>If none may preach but ſuch as be Ordained, then every gifted perſon may not preach; but none may preach but ſuch as be Ordained.</hi> Tit. 1. 5. <hi>I will that thou Ordain Elders, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Whereas firſt, As I have already ſaid and proved, <hi>Paul</hi> and divers others did preach before they were Ordained.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, That unleſs men did preach before Ordination, there was no ground for which they ſhould be Ordained, if their Gifts be not manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Ordination was not upon any ſuch account, as that by it they might preach the more lawfully; but that the Gift might firſt be increaſed upon them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14.

                     <hi>If every man muſt ſtudy to be quiet, do his own Work, and keep the bounds of his proper calling, then private men may not be Pulpit-men, but the Apoſtle commands</hi> 1 Theſ 4. 11. <hi>That every man ſtudy to be quiet, &amp;c.</hi> Who are the unquiet men? the gifted brethren or your ſelves? who is it that caſts out floods of contention and unquietneſs but your ſelves? but you would have your brethren to be quiet, and let you alone in your ſin, that ſo the blind leading the blind, both might fall into the ditch; this would be a ſinfull quietneſs and ſilence. But Sir, may not a man follow his Calling, preach, and yet be quiet too? May not the <hi>Nailer</hi> keep his <hi>Hammer,</hi> the <hi>Husbandman</hi> his <hi>Plough,</hi> &amp;c. and come into the Pulpit, and yet be quiet too? Is not preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and propheſying one part of a Chriſtians generall Calling, if gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto it? or may not a Chriſtian come from his <hi>Hides,</hi> his <hi>Shop,</hi> his <hi>Arms,</hi> his <hi>Blew Apron,</hi> to the Pulpit, without a <hi>Black Gown?</hi> Is there ſo much vertue in that, or doth all your office and divinity conſiſt in it? or rather, doth not your colour manifeſt your nature? <hi>Let every one abide in his calling,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 20. This I have anſwered already: it relates to Servants, not to leave their Maſters, after converſion, &amp;c. and not to that end for which you learned Rhetoritians ignorantly apply it, againſt the Lord and his Truth.</p>
                  <p>Your firſt and Second <hi>Query and Anſwer</hi> I wave, as not material to my work in hand. But the Objection you ſeem to Anſwer in it, I ſhall a little touch.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Paul</hi> had a double Calling, why not We?</p>
                  <p>Your Anſwer is,</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:49506:25"/>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>There is a great difference between</hi> Paul <hi>and You; He had much learning, You no learning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Stay Sir; where is it ſaid, <hi>Paul</hi> had ſo much learning? he had the gifts of the Spirit: but what elſe? This is Learning enough for <hi>Paul:</hi> and <hi>mean Abilities:</hi> yet according to the Ability let them miniſter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He had an extraordinary meaſure of the Spirit, had his Learning given him by Revelation, Inſpiration, &amp;c. We by induſtry, ſtudy, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had <hi>Paul</hi> his by the Spirit? and have You yours by another way? No wonder if you make uſe of it to another End. But have you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed gotten another way to get the gifts of preaching? have you <hi>Simon</hi>-like, bought them for mony? or have you <hi>Phariſee</hi>-like, wrought hard for them? oh, the Lord will curſe and blaſt all ſuch gettings: <hi>the Princes of Zoan and ſpiritual Egypt ſhall appear to be fools in the end.</hi> I deny not reading of, and meditation on the Scriptures: But unleſs the Lord freely inſpire and teach by his Spirit, all your ſtudy and reading is nothing. But your Art of ſtudying and making Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons I utterly proteſt againſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly you ſay, <hi>The work of the Miniſtry is a diſtinct Calling, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not ſo diſtinct but that they may make uſe of another, as <hi>Paul. Diſtinct Duties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not ſo diſtinct, but that another may perform them: but he is in a diſtinct manner to attend upon them, and officiate in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The power of the Keys is not given to the Church, but to Peter and his Succeſſors, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(To the Pope and his Miniſters.) But the Keys of the Kingdom were not given to <hi>Peter</hi> more then to <hi>Paul,</hi> but to <hi>Peters</hi> faith, and to all that have obtained or ſhall obtain like precious faith.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Apoſtle labors, 1. That he might not be burdenſom to the Church which was poor. 2. Theſſ.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>But you will not labor, but live upon the People, though poor: you will Lord it over them, and have it from them if they have it, without them.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>That he might ſtop the mouths of falſe Prophets Who would accuſe him for making advantage of the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will not labor, let falſe and true Prophets ſay what they will of you, but will make advantage of the Goſpel: you are ſo far from the Apoſtles temper, that let what mouths will be open againſt you, yet your mouths are ſtill open for the gain.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:49506:26"/>
                  <p>3. <hi>That he might be an Example of Induſtry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you are reſolved notwithſtanding to be Examples of Pride and Idleneſs; you bind heavy burdens for others, and cry out againſt their Idleneſs, but will be ſure not to touch them your ſelves with the leaſt of your fingers.</p>
                  <p>But Fifthly, you confeſs at laſt, <hi>That a man may keep two Callings</hi> (though your ſelves intend not to live lawfully in one) <hi>but a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may teach School, as</hi> Samuel <hi>had a School of yong Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had a Lay Prophet (as you call them) ſaid ſo much, you would have been ready to cry out ignorance, in tearing, wreſting and abuſing Scripture to ſelf Ends; There is never a word of School or Colledge in the Text. But may a man, a Miniſter have two Callings, the one ſubordinate to the other? and then why may he not bake and preach, nayl and preach, patch and preach, and plow and preach too, as well as fiſh and preach, make tents and preach? &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>If the Calling of the Miniſtry be a diſtinct Calling, have diſtinct offices, and duties belonging to it, &amp;c. then every private man (though gifted) may not intrude himſelf into it: but ſo it is</hi> Mat. 16. 19. &amp; 18. 18.

                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, 1. That I have already told you that there is difference between men miniſtring by office, and by gift. The Calling of the Miniſter is diſtinct, yet not ſo diſtinct as to prevent the gifted bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as you imagine; and they may adminiſter according to the meaſure they have received, yet not intrude themſelves into the office of the Miniſtry: and the truth is, that its your ſelves who are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders, pretending your ſelves Miniſters of the Goſpel, when you know not what it is, but are in deed and truth the Peoples Lords and Maſters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You ſay the power of the keys is given to you, and the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and retaining ſins, and not to the body of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, The power of the keys is given neither to Church nor Miniſter: to retain and remit, that is proper only to God, to Chriſt, <hi>who have the keys of Hell and Death, and open and no man ſhuts, and</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49506:26"/> 
                     <hi>ſhut and no man opens:</hi> You would fain dethrone the Pope, and take the power of pardoning out of his hand if you could. But it is the power of the Goſpel that remits ſins; where it comes in power, it brings pardon and peace; where the Goſpel comes in power, and is believed and received, it remits ſins; but where it is not received, there ſin is retained: So that its not the word or authority of a Prieſt, but the power and grace of Chriſt that remits ſins.</p>

                  <p>You conclude, <hi>This new found Officer, a gifted Preacher out of office, is not to be found in the Bible.</hi> I have already proved this truth, that it is commanded and commended; there is both Precept and Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>

                  <head>The twentieth Argument, From the practice of all Reformed Churches.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That which is condemned in all the Churches of God and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their practice, ought not to be tolerated in our Church: but this practice of private mens Preaching without a Call, is condemned by all the Churches of God, and is contrary to their practice.</hi> Ergo.</p>
                  <p>As for the Major, and the Minor, your Churches and your old Divines are no rule for me to walk by; nor to any others who have their eyes in their heads, no further then they follow Chriſt, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit in the Scripture is the rule of Saints; and this I am ſure, the cuſtom of the Churches in the Scripture is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your cuſtoms: their cuſtom was, That Preaching brethren ſhould both Preach, <hi>and Propheſie,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 31. And for thoſe who will be contentious againſt this truth, there was, nor is <hi>no ſuch cuſtom in the Churches of the Lord:</hi> therefore keep the example of your Churches and Divines to your ſelf, who walk not according to the rule; if any man walk not according to this rule, it is becauſe <hi>there is no light in him,</hi> Iſai 8. 20.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I briefly run through your <hi>Pulpit-Guard,</hi> and doubt not but that I have Routed you in all your <hi>Twenty Strong Holds;</hi> that now the way being opened again, the Gifted brethren may come in to your Pulpit without ſin or ſhame.</p>
                  <p>As for your Indictment againſt the Lay-Prophet, as you call him, it is ſo ridiculous, ſo poor and low, not being accompanyed with common reaſon: the Jury you pretend to call, are your Witneſſes, the evidence you call it.</p>
                  <p>You have loſt your ſelf in the very form; no wonder if you are loſt in the matter: you forſake the Scripture, and flie to Apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Churches; or rather to thoſe who call themſelves Churches, Jews,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49506:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> and are not; but we have examined them, and found them lyars; you calling old Divines men of the ſame Principle with your Church; I wonder you left out your Mother Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhe could have ſpoken as much in the caſe as both you and they all have done. You produce Ordinances, <hi>Scots</hi> Covenant, &amp;c. and why not the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition too? Seeing you are upon this account, you might have raked to the bottom, and have brought in all the forces of the King of Darkneſs to this great day of Tryal: But Sir, your Judge, Jurates, Evidence, and all are too low and weak to amaze or amuſe your preaching Brethren: It ſeems you have conſidered, and wiſely brought in the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> for one in your third Edition; and that, though laſt in name, yet I ſuppoſe firſt in being, and father to all the reſt of your Jurates witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>And here, before I paſs, becauſe you begin to Judge, I ſhall let you ſee, not mine, but the Scriptures judgment upon the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the Nations, who propheſie lyes in the name of the Lord, ſmiting others in the face, ſaying, <hi>Which way went the Spirit of God from me to thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Judge is Chriſt himſelf, who is not only both Lord, <hi>Judge, and King of Saints,</hi> Iſai. 33. 22. but of the world too, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 99. 1.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But ſtay a little Sir: is it lawfull for a man to teach his Family, and is it unlawfull for him to teach others? May he not teach the ſame to others as he teacheth his Family? Is it unlawfull for him to teach the way of God to others? Was there ever the like heard of in this world, Its lawfull for a preaching brother to preach and teach the way of God to his Family, but not to others? for preaching is but a ſpeech, or ſpeaking of words; and this I muſt do to my Family, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all; and this I may do it ſeems, but not to others; the reaſon rendred is, becauſe God commanded it; but it ſeems if God had not commanded it, then it had been unlawfull for a man to teach his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily too: as if the law of Grace did not teach to do good to all, Soul as well as Body, others as well as Family: but its evident there is a time when every man ſhall teach not only his Family, but his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his neighbour too, ſaying, <hi>Know the Lord,</hi> that is, teach the knowledge of the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34 which was, or is a condition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding a glory that was to be revealed. Now Sir, if you and your Churches do all <hi>know the Lord from the leaſt to the greateſt, and have no need of teaching,</hi> let us know it when you come forth next in publike; but if not, be aſhamed and ſilent for ever, thus to mince and wreſt Scripture to your own ends. For till then they ſhall teach every man his brother in the conſtituted Churches, for believers are all brethren; and every man his neighbour; ſo much is clearly implyed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>And thou ſhalt not ſuffer thy brother to ſin, but ſhalt reprove him, and tell him his fault &amp;c. And comfort one another with the ſame comforts with which you your ſelves have been comforted,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You ſay, <hi>If it be granted, that</hi> Abraham <hi>did preach publikely, yet</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:49506:33"/> 
                     <hi>it will not be any advantage, becauſe he was a Patriarch, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> Gen. 2. 7. <hi>which Title is never given to any one in all the Scripture, but only to one in office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You are miſtaken much in this likewiſe: For firſt, I ſay, Propheſie is not an office, but a gift; ſo it was in the old, ſo in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>They propheſied according to the meaſure of the gift received,</hi> and no further: and I ſay, that the Name or Title of office or officer is not given to a Prophet in all the Scripture, becauſe it is a gift, and not an office.</p>
                  <p>Hence I conclude (contrary to yours) that as propheſie is a gift, and <hi>Abraham</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets did propheſie <hi>according to the meaſure of the gift received,</hi> both in the old and new Teſtament; So may every Nayler, Taylor, Artificer, having received the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, according to their meaſure, propheſie and preach forth the truths of God for the good of others.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, <hi>That propheſying was an extraordinary gift, and that spirit given but to few.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, In the time of the Law it was ſo, but in the Goſpel dayes it is not ſo; propheſying in the Goſpel, it is <hi>to speak to edification, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and comfort,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 3. which is proper to all the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as in the ſame Chapter, none exempted but women, ver. 34. and they may propheſie too, though not in the Church, or at leaſt by permiſſion of the Church, 1 Cor. 11. 5. all men that have the gift, may teach in the Church, 1 Tim. 2. 12. its implyed by the womans prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>the teſtimony of Jeſus is the spirit of propheſie,</hi> and this is given to the brethren, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. and he that can ſpeak experimentally of the work of Chriſt for him, in him, and teſtifie his worth and work to others, is a Prophet, and may, nay ought to declare this Jeſus to others; every ſpirituall man is a Prophet, but the Saints are all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, therefore all Prophets. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 37.

                  <p>From Numb 11. 25. to 30. Eldad <hi>and</hi> Medad <hi>propheſied, and</hi> Moſes <hi>wiſheth that all the Lords people were Prophets.</hi> Ergo, <hi>All that have gifts, may propheſie and preach.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In anſwer to this, firſt you ſay, <hi>That this was an extraordinary ſpirit of propheſie.</hi> Grant it to be ſo, yet the ſpirit of propheſie in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49506:33"/> is ordinary and proper to all the Saints; its poured out upon them all, and accordingly they may propheſie.</p>
                  <p>2. The ſpirit of propheſie here ſpoken of, was a ſpirit of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as appears by the Context, ver. 16, 17. you had done very well to have produced one Scripture in the Bible if you could, that ſaith the ſpirit of government is a ſpirit of propheſie; Blindneſs with a witneſs! Do you not know that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a prophet as well as a prince and Leader of the People? and that ſpirit of propheſie that was upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> was given likewiſe to the Seventy. I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but that they might be, and were the better enabled to govern by this ſpirit; but the ſpirit of government is nowhere called the ſpirit of propheſie; then all good and wiſe Governours are Prophets, and when they conſult and talk about Government, they do prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie by this account. Theſe are a ſort of Prophets I never heard or read of in Scripture; its true, many Governours were Prophets, but not as Governours, neither were they Governours as they were Prophets.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Moſes</hi> his wiſh was not that all might preach, but that they might be able to rule, <hi>oh that the Lords people had a ſpirit of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c.</hi> It ſeems by your words that <hi>Moſes</hi> would have all the people to be governours; who then ſhould be governed? for if all had the ſpirit of propheſie, they muſt make uſe of it accordingly, they muſt govern, &amp;c. but I have told you already that there is a difference between propheſying and governing: So that <hi>Moſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is, <hi>That all the Lords people were Prophets,</hi> and then they might propheſie, if Prophets. He doth not deſire to have Prophets, and intend to forbid them to propheſie, like the Prieſts of the Nation, that pray that God would ſend Labourers into the Harveſt, and when they come, are mad at them, and would hang them if they could. You ſay that his wiſh implies, that none might propheſie till they were Prophets, and men in office. I ſay the contrary, it implies that none could propheſie untill they had the gift, and then they might, and may propheſie; but your ſelves it is who propheſie or preach, if I may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſingly give it that term, without gift or office either; as for gift, you are enemies to it, unleſs Univerſity gifts, the ſmoke of the pit, and ſo what you do is by art; make it, and then ſell it, this is your gift; and as for office, I have told you the riſe of that already, and from whence it came. You conclude, <hi>That to your apprehenſion it cannot hang together, becauſe Prophets in office might propheſie, that therefore Lay-men might propheſie.</hi> But I ſay, all the Lords people are Kings,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49506:34"/> Prieſts and Prophets, and may Propheſie, &amp;c. You ſay <hi>It will come no nearer together then St</hi> Jermans <hi>Lips, which were nine mile aſunder:</hi> Its like this was the Saint that ſwallowed the Ox you mentioned; but its ſtrange he could not ſwallaw his tail too, his lips being at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: Its like this <hi>Jerman</hi> was the great grandfather to the Saint <hi>Perſons</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> for they could never ſwallow ſo much as they do, if their lips were not at a great diſtance each from other; but its like Sir, you do but tell a lye in jeſt; his lips were not altogether at ſuch a diſtance as you mention; if they were, he had a very great mouth its like, and a body ſutable to it; he could digeſt Oxen, Pigs, and Geeſe; nothing comes amiſs, it ſeems.</p>

                  <p>And what is the reaſon then that you muſt have ſo much teaching in your Congregations, and ſo little profit? that there are ſo few that know the Lord, from their being taught of him, as your ſelves confeſs? an evident demonſtration, that neither you, nor they, are the Miniſters of the Church of Chriſt; for he owns none to be his Church, but ſuch as are <hi>taught of him, &amp;c.</hi>

                           <hi>FRom the Example of Chriſt; If he Diſputed in the Temple, and Preached in the Synagogues without a Call, then Lay-men that have Gifts may preach without a Call, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 2. 42. 46. Mat. 9. 35. Luk. 4. 16, 17.</p>
                        <p>Your anſwer is: 1. <hi>That all Chriſts Actions are not for our imitation; he did many things which we may not, cannot do; we muſt walk by Rule, &amp;c. for that which was lawful in Chriſt to do, may be unlawful in us, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer, That thoſe things in Chriſt, which were imitable, its lawful for us to do, if made partakers of the ſame Spirit; and thoſe who are not, <hi>are none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. And where this Spirit is in power, there are gifts according to the meaſure of its working; and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49506:36"/> the Apoſtle ſaith to the Saints in general, <hi>deſire ſpiritual gifts, but rather that ye may Propheſy, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. And Chriſt himſelf ſaith, that his Diſciples ſhould not only do ſuch works as himſelf, <hi>but greater then thoſe, Joh.</hi> 14. 12. If it be objected, <hi>that Chriſt gave to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles his Spirit and Power more then ordinary.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer: They ſtill acted according to the meaſure of the gift re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and accordingly they exhort others to do the like; and if there be not the ſame meaſure manifeſt in the Saints, yet ſtill accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure of the working of Chriſt in them, they are to imitate and follow him; and he that ſaith the Saints are not to imitate Jeſus Chriſt in preaching and declaring his Truth and Goſpel, ſo far as they have received from him, doth both deny and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie him.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, You ſay, <hi>'Tis true, Chriſt disputed, &amp;c. but did not preach unto them; diſputing is one thing, and preaching is another.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer: That diſputing and preaching though differing in the manner and form, yet are one in the ſubſtance; and do the manner and form ſo much change the buſineſs, when the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? See <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 29. chap. 17. 17. <hi>Where</hi> Paul <hi>diſputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the</hi> Grecians, <hi>and that in their Synagogues and in the market daily with them that met him.</hi> See <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. what it was he diſputed about, <hi>he preached to them Jeſus and the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, &amp;c.</hi> Paul <hi>diſputed with the devout perſons about their Idolatry, and preached the true God and Chriſt Jeſus unto them;</hi> and thus did Chriſt diſpute in the <hi>Temple, and preach to the Doctors, and that to their amazement to;</hi> I query the difference in ſubſtance, between ſpending an houres time in ſpeaking to a Congregation, or in ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much time in asking queſtions and anſwering doubts; and thus preſenting the ſame truth, though in another form, I ſuppoſe this would be the moſt profitable way of preaching, ſometimes, if it were uſed.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you ſay, <hi>was called extraordinarily, and ſent by the Father to preach glad tidings to the meek,</hi> Joh. 20. 21.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> He that ſent Chriſt Jeſus extraordinarily, ſends the Lay-Prophets (as you deridingly call them) ordinarily; and according to their meaſure, it is work their work to preach <hi>the glad tidings of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. You ſay, <hi>The people took him for a Teacher ſent from God; for it was a faſhion amongſt the Jews, that if any one did come to their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſidſtical</hi>
                           <pb n="68" facs="tcp:49506:37"/> (viz. <hi>Church) meetings, who was known to have ſome gift of underſtanding in the holy Scripture, &amp;c. They would intreat him to make them partakers of it, for their common edification.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer: It ſeems by your own confeſſion, that the Jews and Jewiſh Doctors, Scribes and Phariſees and Hypocrites, (for all give conſent, none oppoſes) had more honeſty, and love to the truth and humility in them, then you Parſons of the Nation, who will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no ſuch faſhion; no gift nor light ſhall ſhine forth amongſt you, but that which ſhines forth in and by you; and if that be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>how great is you darkneſs,</hi> who will admit of no light but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? therefore wo to you, worſe then <hi>Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>3 You ſay, <hi>The fame of Chriſt went out through all Regions, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 4 14, 15.</p>
                        <p>And doth not the fame of many of your preaching brethren both for life and doctrine go forth? &amp;c. And is it not your work Prieſt-like, to defame and reproach them with lyes and ſcandals? witneſs your <hi>Looking-Glaſs for Anabaptiſts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You ſay, <hi>Let Artificers and Lay-Prophets ſhew ſuch a life, ſuch doctrine, ſuch Miracles as Chriſt; you know no man that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer: You are miſtaken, you would envie them the more; for it is their life and doctrine conformable to Chriſt, which is the cauſe why you envie them; becauſe they are more free from covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then your ſelvs, will not take Tythes, or a ſtinted allowance, more free from pride, will not exalt themſelves above the people, and ſet themſelves in the room of Chriſt; more free from idleneſs, will not be aſhamed to follow their Callings, and preach and diſpute forth truth too, more free from Antichriſtianſm; they will not, dare not, make the world the Church, and ignorant carnal ſouls Chriſtians; take the charge or cure of ſouls as you call it, <hi>(viz)</hi> of Pariſhes, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding them; but chuſe rather with Chriſt to go from place to place, preaching the Doctrine of the Goſpel, for converſion of ignorant ſouls, not for to eſtabliſh them in their ignorance; they preach Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Chriſt without any preceding creature qualification, and holineſs following as a frute of this faith. Now who comes neareſt in life and doctrine unto Chriſt? your ſelves or the preaching brethren? and yet you envie them, for want of that which in your ſelves is very rarely to be found; <hi>out of thine own mouth ſhalt thou be condemned, &amp;c.</hi> Doſt thou envie the Lay-Prophets for want of that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49506:37"/> which thou haſt not thy ſelf? nay, for want of that which ſhines forth more eminently in them, then in your ſelves? <hi>(viz.)</hi> life and doctrine conformable to Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>4. Your Queſtion ſtill is, <hi>Whether Chriſt taught publikely before he was thirty years of age, and before he was baptized? &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> You have heard that he diſputed before; and that for ſubſtance is one with preaching; and that he did it publikely in the Temple, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>5. You ſay, <hi>If you grant that it was the practiſe of the Jewiſh Church to admit of all, &amp;c. yet this corrupt and irregular practiſe, can be no preſident for us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer: You call that <hi>corrupt and irregular,</hi> which the Scriptures do not; nay, that which the Scripture juſtifies both by preſident and precept, as you have heard already, not only of Chriſt, but of <hi>Saul</hi> immediately upon his converſion, <hi>Act. 9. 20. the ſcattered brethren, Act. 8. &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But Sir, Its no wonder to hear you crying out ſo much upon irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and diſorder of the orderly Chriſtians, and that for their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when your ſelves walk at ſuch a vaſte diſtance from all Scripture or ſpiritual order.</p>

                        <p>Act. 8. 4. <hi>They that were ſcattered abroad, went everywhere preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, &amp;c. Hence they gather, that all that can may preach, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You ſeem to ſcorn at this ſtrong hold, as if you could pull it down with eaſe; but ſoft you Sir, not ſo eaſily done as ſaid.</p>
                        <p>You ſay, <hi>Firſt it cannot be proved that all theſe diſperſed, were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men out of Office.</hi> Philip <hi>was one of theſe disperſed ones, who was an Evangeliſt,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>Hence you conclude that they were not all private men, there were Apoſtles, Prophets, the ſeventy Diſciples, &amp;c. they might be ſome of theſe, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer: Firſt, That <hi>Philip</hi> is not called an Evangeliſt before this time of perſecution; for he was one of the Deacons for the poor newly elected, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 5. and Deacons you ſay may not preach, their Office is not to that end: yet <hi>Philip</hi> preaches not as a man in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as an Evangeliſt, for that he was not, unleſs his preaching did Evangelize him, for he preached Chriſt unto them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. That was the glad tidings <hi>of remiſſion of ſins by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the word Evangeliſt from Evangelion; a Cryer or Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher of good news; So that if he was now an Evangeliſt, it was his preaching and publiſhing of the Goſpel made him ſo.</p>
                        <p>And whereas you ſay, there were <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> I ſay, and the Scripture ſaith, that the Apoſtles were at <hi>Jeruſalem not ſcattered;</hi> And as for Prophets and Evangeliſts, you read of none before this ſcattering time; As for the ſeventy Diſciples, they were not men in office, their time was limited them, and their miſſion ended at leaſt at the death of Chriſt; for the twelve might not preach after that, by vertue of any former miſſion, but were to <hi>ſtay at Jeruſalem</hi> (in the laſt miſſion) until they <hi>had received power from on high;</hi> therefore if the Seventy were amongſt them, or any of the Seventy, that is nothing for your purpoſe, who indeavor to darken truth with words, that ſo you may delude the ſimple.</p>
                        <p>Yet thirdly, Its ſaid, <hi>That all the Church were ſcattered, &amp;c.</hi> And if you will have Evangeliſts and Prophets which the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not, and the Seventy, or part of them, which is nothing to your purpoſe; yet were theſe all the Church? was there not 3000 <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted at one Sermon?</hi> Act. 3. and many more after, who walked in ſweet fellowſhip; and yet muſt all theſe needs be Apoſtles,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49506:38"/> Prophets, &amp;c. in your ſence? if ſome of them were ſuch, dare you affirm that they were all ſuch, the Scripture being ſo apparantly clear to the contrary, every circumſtance weighed? Is not your own Argument a <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> becauſe there were 12 Apoſtles, and <hi>Philip</hi> was afterwards an Evangeliſt? and there were ſeventy Diſciples once Comiſſioned, which miſſion was ended at the death of Chriſt; the whole Church was ſcattered except thoſe Apoſtles, and none elſe you own; therefore it might be Apoſtles, Prophets, &amp;c. The Apoſtles not ſcattered, but ſtill at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> no Prophets nor Evangeliſts we read of before this, the Seventy non-Commiſſioned; a goodly Argument or Anſwer for thoſe who have no eys to ſee, nor hearts to underſtand.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> you ſay, <hi>might give them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> And they might not give them Commiſſions. You men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Act. 15. 22, 23. becauſe the Apoſtles ſent two choſen men of the Church to the Gentils upon ſpecial occaſion, therefore they might miſſion all theſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is one of your own Concluſions, and it looks like your ſelf; there is but little Logick or Retorick in it: you raiſe an Objection, <hi>The Text not doth ſay ſo,</hi> and ſeem to Anſwer it. <hi>Arguments drawn from ſilent Authority conclude nothing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And Sir. Your own Argument it is, that is drawn from ſilent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; they might miſſion them, the Scripture is ſilent, your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concludes nothing; but indeed its like all the reſt; you inſtance amongſt other Examples, <hi>Melchiſedech; we read of no Parents that he had; it doth not follow,</hi> ſay you, <hi>therefore that he had none, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A learned and deep concluſion! Doth not the Scripture ſay, <hi>he was without Father, without Mother? &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 7. 3.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, You ſay, <hi>Did not the Lord give them commiſſion by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation? &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To prove this, you produce the extraordinary (as you call them) <hi>Effects 1. The hand of the Lord was with them,</hi> Act. 11. 21. And dare you ſay, that the hand of the Lord is not with the preaching brethren? &amp;c. 2. <hi>The extraordinary number of converts, their great and quick harviſt ſhews it.</hi> I ſay, In this likewiſe hath the Lord manifeſted his approving and calling of the preaching brethren, the great number of Converts from Antichriſtian and Babyloniſh ignorance and confuſion; the the hand of the Lord hath been with them, and a quick harveſt there
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49506:39"/> hath been through grace: your ſelves it is that moſt evidently and eminently prove your ſelves Non-called of the Lord, upon this account; no hand of the Lord hath been with you, no Converts drawn to Chriſt by you; but take your Pariſhes, and your Tythes, ſouls periſh for want of knowledge: and if you make two or three in your Pariſh a little zealous and formal in Antichriſtian wayes, you bleſs your ſelves, make them the ſeal of your Apoſtleſhip immediatly.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, you ſay by way of Conceſſion, giving, though not granting, &amp;c. you will clear all by asking two queſtions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>When did theſe diſperſed Diſciples preach?</hi> &amp;c. you anſwer, <hi>in times of perſecution; therefore thoſe which were ſcattered, &amp;c.</hi> imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if they had not been ſcattered, they had not preached.</p>
                        <p>Now you think you have hit the nayl upon the head; but Sir, a word by the way; 1. Did, or could perſecution make that to be lawfull, which you ſay in it ſelf is ſinfull and unlawfull? is it firſt ſinfull and unlawfull in your deep judgement, and yet lawfull in perſecution? This is Logick contrary to your own practiſe; you do that in fear of perſecution, which you would never do in love without: and leave undone that you would have done; you could ceaſe preaching of Lectures, afternoon-Sermons, &amp;c. in the Epiſcopal time for fear of perſecution before it came; not preach the more, as you confeſs the preaching brethren did; but I ſuppoſe it would have been ſinfull for you to have preached, if perſecution had come.</p>
                        <p>2. I anſwer, Have not your preaching brethren preached in times of perſecution too? have not there been many <hi>Sauls</hi> that have breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out threatnings againſt them? and would not theſe prieſtly Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees as gladly as ever <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Stevens,</hi> have conſented unto their death? nay, have they not ſought after it, as <hi>Eſau</hi> the bleſſing, with tears? But yet bleſſed be him who is in the buſh, they cannot obtain their deſires. Yet of late daies have not many been impriſoned, the Churches ſcattered, &amp;c. and then upon your own account, is it not a time for the brethren to preach, &amp;c?</p>
                        <p>Your ſecond Quaere is, <hi>Where did they preach?</hi> You anſwer, <hi>Not at Jeruſalem, a planted, ſettled, conſtituted Church, but amongst the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, &amp;c.</hi> You ſay, <hi>That may be lawful in an unplanted Church, &amp;c. which is utterly unlawful in a planted, conſtituted Church, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer, 1. That its undoubtedly lawfull in a conſtituted Church; for the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 Cor. 14. <hi>Ye may all prophoſie one by one,</hi> that is, in a conſtituted Church; and <hi>God gives gifts to men to profit</hi>
                           <pb n="73" facs="tcp:49506:39"/> 
                           <hi>withall,</hi> others as well as themſelves. And they are undoubtedly none of the Churches of Chriſt, who deny the free operation of the Spirit of Chriſt in the brethren; they are ſuch as quench the Spirit, and deſpiſe propheſying.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I anſwer, That the publike preaching of the brethren in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not in conſtituted Churches of Chriſt, neither in Miniſters, Members, nor in Manners, in Doctrine, Worſhip, or Diſcipline, but of Antichriſt and the Devil; <hi>for his ſervants you are to whom you obey,</hi> &amp;c. therefore its lawful, and a fit time for them to preach for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the Saints out of Babylon and Confuſion; and that upon your own account, its a greater work to gather ſouls out of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, then out of Heatheniſme and downright Idolatry.</p>

                     <hi>Acts 13. 14, 15. Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> coming into the Synagogue, the Rulers ſent to them, not as Apoſtles, but as men having gifts, that if they had any word of exhortation, they ſhould ſay on.</p>
                  <p>You anſwer 1. <hi>That</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>were men in office, &amp;c. and had commiſſion to teach the Nations, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer 1. That Prophets, as I have already proved, were not men in office, but in gift; and as for the Apoſtleſhip of <hi>Paul,</hi> he owned it not in way of office, as from men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. and he preached before this in Chap. 13. by way of gift; you dare not deny it; and the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſending of them, was not that they were ever the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to any office, for they had been at the work before; but the Lord ſaid, <hi>Separate me Saul and Barnabas to the wark whereunto I have appointed them,</hi> that is, let them not abide in the Church, but go forth to the work appointed for them, preach to the world where was moſt need; ſo that it was no new work or office, but a going on in the work of the Lord, in the gift of the Spirit, <hi>which was not of man, or by man, but by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>2.

                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt, I cannot but take notice of your ignorance, in call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an approved practiſe both in Law and Goſpel, a corrupt Jewiſh cuſtome; if it had been ſo indeed, then no Prophet might have ſpoken unto them, who propheſied by gift only; and for the moſt of them, they did no miracle to convince the people that they were extraordinarily ſent.</p>
                  <p>If it had been a corrupt practiſe, they ſhould in your order have perſecuted <hi>John</hi> for want of miſſion; he did no miracle, yet preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a new doctrine of Repentance: and the ſcattered brethren ſhould have had no admittance; the cuſtom ſhould have prevented them: as for the new Teſtament, it was the cuſtome, as hath been proved already, for gifted brethren to preach; and for thoſe that were contentious, and denyed it, <hi>There was no ſuch cuſtome in the Church of God.</hi>

                  <p>3.

But its juſt like all the reſt of your preaching, do and undo, contradict upon every occaſion. To clear your buſineſs, you quaere firſt, <hi>Who it was that preached?</hi> Apollos. 2. <hi>What was he? A Miniſter. How is that proved?</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 5. <hi>Who is Paul, who Apollos, but Miniſters, &amp;c?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer firſt, its true, he was a Miniſter by way of gift, and ſo are all the gifted brethren, nay all believers are Miniſters; for a Miniſter is the ſervant of the Lord, and ſo are all the Saints; <hi>As every one hath received the gift, ſo let him miniſter;</hi> and upon this account was <hi>Apollo</hi> a Miniſter, and no other at that time, neither can you prove that he was any other after: you produce 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. which was a long time after this preaching, and that Scripture doth not prove him a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in office, as you pretend neither: but a little to diſcover your jugling with the Truth, as if you were blind, or did think others to be as blind as your ſelf, you pretend to make much for your ſelf in the firſt and ſecond, <hi>That he was a coadjutor with Paul,</hi> &amp;c. But Sir, do you believe that he was ſo when he firſt preached? Nay Sir, its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the contrary; for he was a ſtranger, not only to <hi>Paul,</hi> but to the reſt of the brethren, <hi>ver.</hi> 27.</p>
                     <p>2. He was inſtructed <hi>but only in the baptiſm of John, and needed an Aquila and Priſcilla to teach him the way of the Lord more plainly.</hi> And was he an ordained Miniſter think you, and yet ignorant of the way of the Lord, and the doctrine of Chriſt, knowing but the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of <hi>John?</hi> who ordained him think you? Away therefore with your blind Sophiſtry; you may as well reaſon, that becauſe you are a man now, you were one an hundred years ago; becauſe <hi>Apollos</hi> was a Miniſter, and might be ſo in office, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. therefore he was ſo before he was known of the brethren, or knew the way of the Lord, or the baptiſm of Chriſt, only the baptiſm of <hi>John;</hi> a likely concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>3. You ask, <hi>What were the gifts of this Miniſter? &amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>An elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent man. 2. Mighty in the Scriptures. 3. Inſtructed in the way of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49506:41"/> the Lord; 4. Fervent in ſpirit; 5. Taught diligently; 6. The things of the Lord; 7. Bold in the Synagogues.</hi> All theſe I doubt not, if you were not blind, but you might in a meaſure ſee in your preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brethren. &amp;c. 8. <hi>Rare humility; he doth not diſdain to be taught what he knew not, of mean perſons,</hi> far differing from the pride of you parſons, who ſcorn to hear or learn from your Brethren; puft up with pride, and ſelf conceitedneſs of your own worth, knowledge, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, &amp;c. 9. <hi>His teaching was operative, fruitful, &amp;c. he did not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain, &amp;c.</hi> So is your preaching Brethrens work; they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not in vain, though to your grief and pain, that makes you fret again, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Your ſecond query is, <hi>When he preached?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You anſwer, 1. <hi>'Twas in a time when Churches were planting, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So are the Churches now planting, and God gives gifts extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, comparitively with your ſelves, for the gathering and building of the Saints.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>'Twas in a time when the corrupt cuſtom was in practice among the Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Anſwer; 1. You have often called it a corrupt cuſtom, when the Scripture calls it not ſo: you have a very foul mouth, to cry out ſo much corruption, where the Scripture is ſilent, and the cuſtom was in it ſelf commendable, both in the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>2. By way of conceſſion, to give what is not granted. Put caſe that it was a corrupt cuſtom, was <hi>Apollos</hi> corrupt in his practice? for he was no Miniſter in office, as is clear; was he corrupt for his preaching out of Office, in making uſe of his opportunity? If you durſt be ſo bold, for ſhame, I make no queſtion but you would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him a corrupt Sectarian-fellow for his labour.</p>
                     <p>3. You anſwer <hi>by way of conceſſion, that</hi> Apollos <hi>was not a man in Office, it twill not help; for this was but an inſtance of the liberty given by the Jews, or taken when given:</hi> And were they not both corrupt? one for giving, the other for taking?</p>
                     <p>You conclude, <hi>Take in all, &amp;c. and in like juncture of time, others of like abilities may do the like.</hi>

                  <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1. 31. <hi>Where the Apoſtle exhorts them to deſire ſpiritual gifts, but rather that they might propheſy; and tels them,</hi> verſ. 31. <hi>They may all Propheſy one by one; hence our brethren conclude, that all that have gifts, may Propheſy, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In your anſwer to this, you pretend a great deal of confidence and aſſurance, that your gifted brethren are deluded <hi>with the word All,</hi> when the truth is, that your ſelf it is who is under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion you ſay, will be, <hi>who are meant by this word All</hi> verſ. 31. <hi>ye may all Propheſy, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You anſwer firſt Negatively: <hi>It cannot be meant of all the Saints, for then women ſhould preach, who are forbidden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer: 1. The Scripture it ſelf is clear, women are excepted, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. <hi>All may, &amp;c.</hi> There is no limitation, no prohibition of any; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept women; and women are not altogether forbidden neither; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this with <hi>cha.</hi> 11. 5. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28. women may Propheſy by permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and in ſubjection to the man, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. You ſay, <hi>Private Profeſſors are nowhere commanded to leave their Callings, and go ſtudy Arts, Sciences, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh blindneſs with a witneſs! Is not the Spirit of Chriſt ſufficient to help men to preach &amp; propheſy, unleſs they ſtudy Arts, and Sciences? the Scripture ſaith, <hi>ye may All Propheſy;</hi> Private men, is a title you have learnt from <hi>Rome;</hi> its true, it doth not ſay you muſt all leave your Callings, and ſtudy Arts, and Sciences; this is not commanded to any, nor practiſed by any; and truly Sir, I think there are none but Aſſes in the things of God, who ſtudy Arts and Sciences, to help them to preach and propheſie: your Scriptures produced, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 20. <hi>ch.</hi> 12. 29. I have anſwered already, therefore I paſs it in this place.</p>
                  <p>2. You anſwer poſitively, <hi>by All is meant all ſuch as are Prophets, the Text is clear,</hi> ver. 29. <hi>Let the Prophets speak, &amp;c.</hi> Thus far you ſay truth, by <hi>All</hi> is meant the Prophets, that is, thoſe who have the ſpirit of Propheſie; you proceed, and ſay, <hi>They were extraordinary;</hi> your reaſon is, <hi>becauſe they spake by Revelation, without ſtudy.</hi> ver. 31. I ſay they were not extraordinary, but ordinary, ſuch as could ſpeak to <hi>edification, exhortation, and comfort,</hi> ver. 3. and this many of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49506:43"/> brethren could do then, and can do now; its your ſelves that are no Prophets; for you cannot ſpeak by revelation, without ſtudy; but in the ſtrength of the Lord, the preaching brethren can: And here it is you are loſt, you meaſure other mens condition by your own; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you cannot preach without ſtudy, therefore you think none elſe can, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I conclude with you, That the word <hi>All, is to be confined to the Prophets, All ye that are Prophets may preach;</hi> All ye that have the Spirit, and ſo the Gift of propheſy may preach and propheſy: for propheſy was no Office, but a Gift, as I have already ſhewed: So then, notwithſtanding all your ſophiſtications and wrenchings, All that have the Gift, may propheſie: the preaching brethren that have the Gift, may propheſy.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>Its worth the obſerving, that the word</hi> Prophet <hi>is never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any but Miniſters, men in Office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have already anſwered, that Prophet or Propheſy, is never called an Office in the Scripture, but a Gift; and the diſtinguiſhment of Chriſt between <hi>a Prophet and a righteous man,</hi> Mat. 10. 41. its not the Office but the Gift; every righteous man hath not a Prophets gift; there are various operations, ſtill the ſame ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>That all that are Prophets, and can open hard Propheſies without ſtudy, interpret Scripture to edification, &amp;c. Who ſo hath theſe Gifts, may uſe them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Sir, where and when do you mean? 1000 years ago, but not now. Why this is all we plead for man; you have granted our deſire; let the Hearers be judges, let the Saints be judges, let the Prophets be judges; God hath given that Spirit of Propheſy, to interpret Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſpeak to edification and comfort of the Saints, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>They are Prophets, becauſe the duties of Prophets are aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No need of ſo much of one thing, being ſo clear and granted of all. But you muſt needs have them <hi>extraordinary Prophets;</hi> and here you harp, or elſe you were gone.</p>
                  <p>But you ſay, <hi>You will eaſily prove them to be extraordinary Prophets;</hi> (but ſtay Sir, not ſo eaſily done as ſaid.)</p>
                  <p>But you ſay, <hi>You prove it,</hi> verſ. 30. <hi>If any thing be revealed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſitteth by, &amp;c. They preached extemporary Revelations, they were by the ſingular Revelation of the Spirit to give the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:49506:43"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I wonder from whence you had this diſtinction of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and extraordinary Prophets; Doth the Scripture teach you any ſuch thing? I ſuppoſe you minde by extraordinary, ſuch as foretold things to come; as in the Old Teſtament, &amp;c. But why you call them extraordinary I know not; and for ordinary, ſuch as by the ſame ſpirit can ſpeak for the edifying of the Saints, the difference is onely in the operation of the ſame ſpirit; in ſome one way, in ſome another, in ſome more, in ſome leſs; but its given to every <hi>one to profit withal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That upon your own account, and in your language, theſe Prophets were ordinary; extraordinary were ſuch as could foretel things to come, as <hi>Elijah, Eliſha, Eſay, &amp;c.</hi> In the New Teſtament <hi>Agabus, Act.</hi> 11. 27. chap. 21. 10. 11. ſuch theſe Prophets were not; For the work of the one was to foretell, of the other to build up and edifie the Church.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>Theſe Prophets are ſet amongst extraordinary Gifts, or Officers,</hi> Epheſ 4. 11.</p>
                  <p>I wonder how you dare thus to abuſe the Scripture and truth? who or where are thoſe Gifts? or as you call them <hi>Officers called extraordinary;</hi> but its your own ignorance, if not baſeneſs, to delude the people under theſe terms you call Apoſtles, and Prophets, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts extraordinary, and pick out from amongſt the ſame, Paſtors, Teachers for ordinary: What Scripture teacheth you this, to call one ordinary, the other extraordinary? If I can ſhew you no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp;c. you ſhall ſhew me no Paſtors, nor Teachers in the World.</p>
                  <p>Well you ſay, <hi>There were three things objected. 1. They could not be extraordinary becauſe their doctrine was to be tryed, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You anſwer firſt, <hi>That this trying and judging, did not conſiſt in calling them to an account, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I ſay, It conſiſted in judging the truth of what was ſpoken, to try the ſpirits whether they were of God; for there were and are falſe Prophets: for this was the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> commended, <hi>Rev. 2. 2. For trying thoſe who ſaid they were Apoſtles, and were not, and found them lyars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. You ſay, <hi>An extraordinary Prophet though in penning Scripture infallible, yet in other things he might err; you inſtance in</hi> Aaron, Exod. 32. 4. Peter Act. 10. 15. <hi>about the calling of the Gentiles, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will make the Scripture it ſelf to be of ſmall Authority, if what
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49506:44"/> you ſay were truth; for all extraordinary Propheſies are written, and if they might and did miſcarry in Propheſying, as you ſay, then you derogate from the truth of Scripture; for all extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies are written.</p>
                  <p>And you ſay, <hi>Extraordinary Prophets may err.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Sir, You have produced no Example of ſuch erring in matter of Propheſy. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Aaron, &amp;c.</hi> did not err in matter of Propheſie; if they had, they had been falſe Prophets like your ſelf; the point in hand at preſent, is about Prophets in time of their Propheſy, <hi>ye may all Propheſy, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And you ſay, <hi>They were extraordinary, and yet might err:</hi> (oh full of all ſubtilty!</p>
                  <p>What? Are all the Propheſies in the Old Teſtament then, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Prophets might err in their Propheſyings?</p>
                  <p>Yet at laſt, you come to ſay, <hi>That all things are not revealed to one; and that which is not revealed to one, may be to another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is truth, and that is the reaſon why all may Propheſy.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>There might be ſomething mingled with that which the Prophets received, and they might adde ſomething of their own, &amp;c. therefore it was to be judged and tryed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And is this truth which you lay down, and yet are they extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary? Note 1. Were there any in the Old Teſtament to judge of the Propheſies, whether they were truth when ſpoken? 2. Might the Prophets extraordinary, as you call them, in their Propheſies, <hi>add of ſelf</hi> unto it, and err in it? let all men judge of the truth of this Doctrine, but its like your ſelf, &amp;c. 3. Did thoſe extraordinary Prophets propheſie according to the Rule of Scripture? and look what others had ſaid before them, or by an immediate Inſpiration? As you confeſs, theſe Prophets were to propheſie <hi>according to the rule of faith,</hi> Iſa. 8. 20. <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony;</hi> Was their propheſie ſubject <hi>to error? had need to be judged? might be ſomething of ſelf in it? tryed if according to Scripture, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet extraordinary; ſtrange and unheard of confuſion! out of your own mouth ſhall you be judged, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. You ſay, <hi>'Tis objected, That thoſe could not be extraordinary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its ſaid,</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>They ſpake to edification, exhortation and comfort, as ordinary Prophets did.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You anſwer it eaſily: <hi>The extraordinary Prophets as</hi> Amos, Eſay, Ezekiel, &amp;c. <hi>did preach to edification, exhortation and conſolation, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:49506:44"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That its more then the Scripture affirms, if they did teach in this way of propheſying.</p>
                  <p>2. If they did, yet they took not their denomination of prophets from this kind of propheſying; but thoſe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. are called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets upon this account, their ſpeaking to <hi>edification, &amp;c.</hi> And this was the end and work of Prophets, to <hi>edifie the Church,</hi> Eph. 4 12. not to foretel of things to come: therefore the Apoſtle renders the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their propheſy, <hi>that All may be inſtructed, and All may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,</hi> verſ. 31. And again, theſe Prophets were ſuch as needed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections from the Apoſtle, as to the manner and order in propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which if extraordinary, they could rather have directed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, as <hi>Agabus,</hi> Act. 21. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>3. You ſay, <hi>'Twas objected, that the Apoſtle forbidding women, did give liberty to men to preach:</hi> you grant by way of conceſſion, <hi>The Apoſtle forbids women, and enjoyns men to preach: But what men? not all Gifted, but all gifted and Called.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, All that are gifted are Called to exerciſe Gift, and may propheſy.</p>
                  <p>2. You draw the Argument thus, <hi>The Apoſtle forbids women gifted or ungifted to preach; therefore all men gifted or ungifted may preach, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the good your Univerſity doth you; make you wiſe to do evil and pervert truth, to draw ſcurrilous concluſions to diſhonor truth and its ſervants; All women gifted or ungifted are in this Scripture prohibited; but all men that have gifts are authorized. And truly, I ſhall ſay thus much too, that I ſhould look upon that member to be very weak and uſeleſs, that hath not ſome gift or other for good in the Church, in the body: But Sir, your ridiculous concluſions will not eſtabliſh you.</p>
                  <p>You conclude, <hi>That all Orders, Officers, Members in the Church above Miniſters, may preach, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I thought you had owned none above you, but that you had ſate in <hi>Peters</hi> chair, been ſupream Lords, to binde and looſe at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, children to the holy Father at <hi>Rome;</hi> but you'l be ſure to own ſuch to be above you, which are not in your account, and then as good as none at all; abſolute Lords for all that. You men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts:</hi> but you think there is neither of theſe in being; therefore you are the chief Lords over all: but you are miſtaken; for Apoſtles Prophets, Evangeliſts, are no more extraordinary in the Church, then <hi>Paſtors, Teachers, &amp;c.</hi> for they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49506:45"/> are all reckoned together, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 11. And if you will ſay, <hi>there are no Apoſtles Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> I will ſay and make it good, there are no <hi>Paſtors, Teachers, Presbyters,</hi> or others, nay no Church of Chriſt, <hi>without Apoſtles, Prophets;</hi> there may be a Church without <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, &amp;c.</hi> but none without <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> He hath ſet in his Church firſt <hi>Apoſtles, then Prophets, &amp;c. and after this Paſtors and Teachers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> men ſent for the gathering of the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Prophets</hi> next, becauſe when gathered, the <hi>Prophets, (viz)</hi> gifted brethren, they exerciſe their gifts for the edifying of the body, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till there be Paſtors and Teachers; and then the gifts of the Prophets are not to be quenched, or ſlighted; for they are Prophets ſtill; and out of the Prophets in proceſs of time, may be choſen men for Office, Teachers; by Office as well as Gift; and theſe are elected by the Prophets, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church; for they are all Prophets, though they have not Gifts alike.</p>
                  <p>So that firſt then in the Churches of Chriſt, there are Apoſtles, men ſent to gather, Apoſtles ſignifying as much: and Prophets when gathered, before the Miniſtry you ſo much cry up.</p>
                  <p>2. Your ſelves are neither <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, nor Teachers,</hi> according to the-Scripture account; for firſt you gather no Churches; but rather endeavor to ſcatter thoſe that are gathered.</p>
                  <p>2.

                  </p>
                  <p>I have anſwered this already, That there is no Office of Propheſy, but Gift only; and they that have abilities may propheſy; the Gift is given them for that end.</p>

                  <p>You ſay <hi>It will appear more fully in the context, and ſcope of the Chapter; having exhorted to duties of Piety in general,</hi> ver. 1, 2. <hi>he comes,</hi> ver. 3. <hi>to 9. to particular duties of Eccleſiaſtical perſons and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> viz. <hi>that they ſhould not be proud of their Gifts, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, it were well if you who ſo account your ſelves, &amp;c. could learn that leſſon: but Sir, you very much fail in your interpretation, for the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the whole Church throughout the whole Chap. and in theſe verſes mentioned, ver. 3. he ſpeaks to the whole Church, <hi>Let no man think of himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> He doth not ſay, let no Miniſters in office think, &amp;c. but no man. <hi>Let no man be proud, or lifted up with his gift, to think more highly then he ought of himſelf; but to think ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, according as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of Faith.</hi> Mark, as God hath dealt to every man; you ſay, every Miniſter in Office, the Scripture ſaith <hi>every man, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 4, 5. the Apoſtle relates to the whole Church, <hi>We being many, are one body, &amp;c.</hi> What Sir, do you ſuppoſe that none are the body of Chriſt, the Church, but the Prieſts? or do you not ſee your ignorance, that its the whole body the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of?</p>
                  <p>2. You ſay <hi>He ſets down a diſtinct and perfect enumeration of all the ſtanding officers in the Church, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That all your wiſdom and Logick have not, cannot diſtinguiſh theſe Officers.</p>
                  <p n="1">2. He enumerates the various gifts in the whole Church; though officers are not excluded, yet there is no office but depends upon gift, elſe no Office.</p>
                  <p>And 1. He mentions Prophets, <hi>Whether propheſie, let us Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, &amp;c.</hi> that is, let thoſe who have that Gift, make uſe of it for the good of the Church. That this is the intention of the Scripture, note firſt, that the Apoſtle is ſpeaking to the whole, as you have heard, Verſe 5.</p>
                  <p>2. The terms under which its expreſs'd; that is, 1. <hi>Propheſie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of faith:</hi> anſwering ver. 3. <hi>according as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of faith.</hi> Hence note, that its every mans liberty, nay duty, to propheſie according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3. See Verſe 7. There, if anywhere, you have the Office, or Miniſtry, <hi>Let us wait on our Miniſtring, &amp;c.</hi> The firſt is a Gift without Office, according to <hi>the proportion of Faith:</hi> the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49506:46"/> other is an office to be waited on, though office depends upon Gift likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>You confeſs, <hi>That this is not the extraordinary, but ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying.</hi> And why this ordinary more then that? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 31. But Sir, it is not your underſtanding of the Scripture that makes you give the right Interpretation of it, but becauſe it ſuits beſt with what you drive at; for that I perceive is your great work, to make the Scripture ſpeak to your own purpoſe, be it what it will.</p>
                  <p>You conclude, <hi>Now let us ſee what they can gather hence; becauſe Paſtors and Teachers, who were Prophets, &amp;c. men in Office are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to Propheſie, and Expound the Word; therefore private perſons may, &amp;c. this is kneading trough Logick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer: Where did you read your Logick in Scripture, that Prophets were called Paſtors; or Paſtors and Teachers called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets? but that you can ſay any thing, make the Scripture to ſay any thing for your own ends: And this is Logick learnt from your father the devil; Read and apply <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44.</p>

                  <p>1 Cor. 11. 5. <hi>Every woman that prayeth or propheſieth with her head covered, &amp;c. Hence ſay they, were women that did propheſy; If gifted women did propheſy, much more may gifted men: thus</hi> Miriam, Anna <hi>and</hi> Hilda <hi>propheſied,</hi> 2 King. 22. 14 &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This I ſuppoſe is a Scripture of your own invention in this place; there are enough more to the purpoſe then this; for I ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to do as your ſelf, turn the Scripture every way for your own ends: yet Sir, I ſhall a little trace you in this, that ſo your pride and folly may appear.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>Here is chalk for cheeſe; we ſpeak of ordinary gifted men, and they flee to women that were called extraordinarily, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And how prove you that Sir? Is there ever ſuch a word in the Text? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 5. he ſaith, <hi>pray or propheſy;</hi> was it extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary praying too? I wonder you left out that.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Phebe, Rom.</hi> 16. 13. You ſay, <hi>She was a Diaconeſs to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to the ſick, and not to preach, or have</hi> Peters <hi>Keyes jingling at her girdle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I thought Sir, you were very loth to loſe the Keys, having been <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors ſo long; but I wonder how you got them from
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49506:47"/> your father the Pope, who ſayth he keeps the chair ſtill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aquila and Priſcilla were helpers to Paul,</hi> Rom. 16. 3. that is, ſay you, <hi>by their private inſtructions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But who told you ſo, that it was by their private inſtructions? and why not publike as well as private?</p>
                  <p>So you ſay, <hi>Not only men, but women ſhould teach their children, ſervants, neighbours the way of the Lord.</hi> Prov. 1. 8. &amp; 6. 20. Act. 18. 26. Tit. 2. 3.</p>
                  <p>Confeſs the truth ſometimes, that out of your own mouth you may be condemned; this is all we plead for, that its the duty of the Saints, according to the meaſure of their gift, and proportion of faith, to teach the way of the Lord to children, neighbours, any, as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is offered: but I ſuppoſe you have a ſecret reſervation, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to that word <hi>private, &amp;c.</hi> and why <hi>private</hi> Sir? Is it lawfull in private, and unlawfull in publike? where doth the Scripture make this diſtinction? But Sir, I ſuppoſe I have found you; you will keep it in private, that ſo your <hi>Diana</hi> may ſtand, your honour and eſteem among the vulgar; and that your god, your bellies may be fed to the full, &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>As for that place, 1 Cor. 11. 5. you ſay, <hi>The words are not taken actively for womens preaching, but paſſively, for their attending on prayer and propheſying, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And who told you ſo Sir? you are very quick of apprehenſion, ready to give interpretations: I ſuppoſe you may thank your Logick, Rhetorick, and Philoſophy for it. Is there ever ſuch a word in the Text? nay, is it not evident that there is no ſuch thing intended? Examine the Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſpeaks of men in particular, and women in particular; <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that prayeth and propheſieth; every woman that prayeth and propheſieth;</hi> he doth not ſay every one that doth attend upon pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If he intends the woman, that ſhe doth attend upon the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of another, then he intends the ſame to the men likewiſe; for its one and the ſame; only the manner differs: So then there is no rule given to him that ſpeaks in propheſie, either man or woman.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Text ſaith, <hi>Every woman that propheſieth, &amp;c.</hi> Pray tell me Sir, whether when a man propheſieth and preacheth the things of God, whether the women that are preſent hearing, do propheſie then, becauſe the man doth? if the women, then the men: where
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49506:47"/> now Sir, you will make all Prophets anon, both men and women.</p>
                  <p>2. You ſay, <hi>You muſt diſtinguiſh of propheſying; there is propheſying which is preaching; thus ſay ſome, theſe women did not propheſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I thought you were gotten into a Wood, almoſt loſt, you hear what ſome ſay. But how can they tell? who told either you or them ſo?</p>
                  <p>2. You ſay, <hi>Propheſying is taken for publiſhing, and ſinging praiſe, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 68. 11. <hi>there were ſhee preachers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If ſo Sir, why not men and women to teach and preach according to the gift? See to this purpoſe <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16.</p>

                  <p>There is no ſuch thing: Compare that with this, and it forbids but the diſorder, not the thing; by permiſſion, in ſubmiſſion, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that have a gift may propheſie, which is the ſence of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, you are malitiouſly miſtaken, and the ignorance is in your ſelf. 1. In calling them Anabaptiſts, for practiſing Baptiſm according to the Scripture, that grieves you it ſeems; but you have learnt a new way, both for matter and manner: for matter, Babies inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: for manner, ſprinkling at the holy Font, inſtead of baptiſing in a River: You are loth to go in there with your long Gownes, you have found a better way then ever was preſcribed or practiſed; who now Sir are the Ignoramuſſes?</p>
                  <p>2. You belie them (but that is no wonder) you ſay, <hi>they gather that a man may call himſelf to preaching.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its your own forgery; they never ſaid ſo; but 1. If God gives gifts, then he cals them to it. 2. The Church finding ſuch gifts, approves of them, ownes them, rejoyceth in them, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Scripture you mention, you ſay firſt, <hi>It doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they were Miniſters, and Preachers, but rather Deacons and</hi>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:49506:48"/> 
                     <hi>Church-officers, who did ſerve and miniſter to the neceſſities of the Saints, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is but your word, and there is no probability for it, but that you have learned to evade truth; but all will not ſerve you; I ſay therefore firſt, they were Miniſters, and that preaching ones too.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Miniſters, the word is clear for that; <hi>They gave themſelves to the miniſtry of the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Preaching ones too, ver. 16. <hi>That ye ſubmit your ſelves to ſuch, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth;</hi> they were ſuch as did help with the Apoſtles, and labour; In what? <hi>In giving Alms, or diſtributing?</hi> No. Labour in the Goſpel; its uſually applyed that way, <hi>I laboured more abundantly then they all,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10. and the Elders that <hi>labour in the word, are worthy of honour,</hi> &amp;c. this word Labour is nowhere given to Deacons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet out of office, only by gift; I prove it thus. 1. Its the houſhold of <hi>Stephanas</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> baptized, and was his firſt fruits at Achaia; tell me when they did, or any elſe chuſe a houſhold or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to be all Miniſters in office?</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>They addicted themſelves to the Miniſtry,</hi> were not called by office, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>That ye ſubmit to ſuch, and every one that helpeth;</hi> he doth not ſay to every one in office, but to every one that helpeth, that is, every one that hath the gift, and helpeth to the building up of the reſt; let others ſubmit their judgements unto ſuch in points of difference and controverſies. If <hi>Paul</hi> intended it to every Paſtor in the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, there were very many then it ſeems; for there was the houſhold of <hi>Stephanas,</hi> and ſo every one elſe that doth labour with us; how many officers will you make in the Church, if what you ſay were truth?</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>They gave themſelves to the ſervice, were not compelled or hired, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems at leaſt then they were not ſuch officers as the Parſons of the Nation are; for they muſt be hired, and well paid too, or elſe they will not ſerve; they are far from the temper of <hi>Stephanas</hi> and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Their calling I have already proved unto you, not by office, but
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49506:48"/> gift, and they readily did the ſervice; you call the Anabaptiſts the Firebrands of Societies. Sir, 1. They have been, and will be a firebrand to Antichriſtian Societies, and the Lord will by them daſh ſuch to pieces by their doctrine, life and practiſe. 2. They are the only upholders of lawfull Societies, both Civill and Divine. 3. Your ſelves are in deed and truth the firebrands of Societies, both Civill and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; For Civill, you could be content to burn up Nations, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, People, and all, for the eſtabliſhment of your own intereſts, burn up Churches, the Societies of Saints, rail, and call them all that naught is, when your ſelves are the men upon whom the guilt lieth; you abuſe and wreſt the Scripture to your own ends and intereſt, viz. <hi>No man taketh this honour to himſelf without a Call, &amp;c.</hi> Its ſpoken of the Prieſts under the Law, who were a type of Chriſt, and not of your baſtard Tribe of Levites, &amp;c.

Slay their ſins and mortifie the old man, &amp;c. 4. In reſpect of common annoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo all Believers have an unction of the Spirit of God, which leads them into all truth,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 20. <hi>and being thus taught, they may and muſt teach others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are your own words: And now Sir, where is the Fallacie? in your ſelf, or in the preaching brethren? your own confeſſion ſhall be your judge one day. But you pretend to mend all again, with the word <hi>privately,</hi> the way of the Lord; how often have you confeſt the truth, and then think to lick your ſelf whole again, with that one word, that the Scripture ownes not, upon your account; but breathes forth light and truth to the contrary, as clear as the Sun when it ſhines at the noon-day; yet when you have confeſt the truth, you pretend to over-turn it again, with that word <hi>private;</hi> with ſhame acknowledge your ignorance, if not your malice.</p>
                  <p>2. You anſwer: <hi>You'l ſhew the weakneſs of this Argument,</hi> you ſay, <hi>per idem</hi> thus; <hi>The office of a King is to rule; but every Believer is a King.</hi> Ergo. <hi>And if ſo, why do ye not get into the Throne? &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer: Your Argument looks like your ſelf. Becauſe Believers are Kings; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they do and ſhall reign with Chriſt over Sin, Satan, Fleſh, and World, with him in glory; this is the truth in the myſtery: but you draw ſcurrilous and reproachful concluſions to make the Saints and truth contemptible; be adviſed of your folly in time and repent, leaſt you walking <hi>in John a Leydens wayes,</hi> cry up Office, Office, thinking to carry away all the crown and glory from the Saints, when indeed and truth you have no more part nor portion in the buſineſs then <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer, &amp;c. I ſay, be warned of crying up your ſelves above the Magiſtrate, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Councel of State, &amp;c. reſolving to ruine all, if you may not reign, leaſt you come to <hi>John a Leydens end, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>1 Pet. 4. 10, 11. <hi>As every one hath received the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, &amp;c. every man muſt uſe the talent God hath given him, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 25. <hi>Hence (you ſay) they argue, All that have gifts, muſt uſe them; but many private men have gifts;</hi> Ergo, <hi>they muſt uſe them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your anſwer's true: <hi>But where? not publikely; for then many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who have excellent Gifts ſhould be Preachers, but private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have no other ſhift to put off truth, but this ſilly diſtinction of publike, private, &amp;c. you have worn it thred-bare, being ſo often put to it in the very plain expreſs terms of Scripture; that you know not where to ſhift your ſelf, but put off your load upon this word <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate:</hi> to which I have ſaid ſo much in anſwer unto it, that I ſuppoſe the moſt weak and ſimple may ſee into your Fallacie: but Sir, you leave your caſe deſperate at laſt; but no wonder, when it is ſo bad, that it ſeems you are glad to ſteal away from it; for you confeſs that which you have ſo long oppoſed.</p>
                  <p>You ſay <hi>He comes ver. 11, to the gift of Propheſie, and miniſtring ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Abilities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it the Gift of Propheſie? indeed its well you confeſs it: It ſeems you had not audaciouſneſs enough in you to contradict this truth ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo clear in your conſcience.</p>
                  <p>You ſay <hi>Its the gift of Propheſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Surely theſe are not Prophets in Office; you dare not ſay ſo it ſeems; but as every man hath received this Gift, ſo let him miniſter, if any man ſpeak, &amp;c. Here you are blank, and glad to be gone with ſpeed to the next: you ſaying ſo little, and to ſo little purpoſe, the Scripture it ſelf being ſo undeniably clear, that daunts all gain ſayers, as appears in your anſwer.

                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, Your Anſwer to this Objection and Scripture, ſeems to carry the langage of the old Proverb in it, <hi>more knave then fool:</hi> was there ever the like heard of, either from Pope, or Devil? what, not a word of anſwer, but ſcurrility, and reproach? what, reproach the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf? calling it a Sceleton, a parcell of bare bones &amp;c? Is this enough to give ſatisfaction? does the light ſhine ſo clear out of that Scripture, that it compels you to flie from it, as not being able to look it in the face, or give anſwer to it, but cry out againſt it? hath not this been your practice in all Ages? when you meet with truth, that you cannot gain-ſay-it, then to reproach it, and render it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible to the people; but be ye ſure you will have but little thank for it at the laſt day: but ſeeing you leave this Scripture as being worthy of no anſwer, but baſe and ſcurrilous names, &amp;c. I ſhall ſay ſomthing to it, that its light may appear, and your dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the more unto the world.</p>
                  <p>The truth there aſſerted, is this, That God in all Ages hath made choice of fooliſh, weak, and unlikely things; by it to confound and bring to nothing, things that are.</p>
                  <p>And this he doth, either 1. In the work of Converſion; the poor receive the Goſpel; <hi>Publican, and Harlots go into Heaven before the ſelf righteous</hi> zealous hariſees; for Chriſt <hi>came not to call the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but ſinners, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>You cry up your humanity, fleſhly wiſdom, Arts, Sciences, &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall as briefly trace you in it, and ſo have done too.</p>
                  <p>This you ſay is objected, <hi>Your miniſtry is Antichriſtan, you are Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh Diviners, Egyptians juglers, limbs of the Divel, proud, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>A very fine way to ſhift of truth from your ſelves, and ſo go on in your wickedneſs; ſaying, <hi>you ſhall have peace,</hi> although you <hi>add ſin to ſin, and walk after the imaginations and ſtubbornneſs of your own hearts:</hi> As well might the falſe Prophets and falſe Apoſtles rejoyce,

                  <p>You ſay, <hi>God is beholding to us, for the kindneſs we ſhew to his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Then he is but little beholding to the men of your coat; for you are the greateſt enemies to them in the world.</p>
                  <p>2. But is God beholding unto men for the kindneſs ſhewed to his Ambaſſadors in good earneſt? I muſt confeſs I am now informed by you, in that I knew not before; for I was ſo ignorant in this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, that I thought God had not been beholding to any man, no not to Embaſſadors themſelves; becauſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>when we have done all that we can, yet we are unprofitable ſervants; that we are in Chriſt Jeſus created unto good works, that we ſhould walk in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Sir, I ſuppoſe you do in this as in divers other things, but tell a lye in jeſt; for you ſuppoſe your ſelves to be Embaſſadors; and you would faine perſwade the people to love you, and honor you, though with a lye: but that Miniſtry which cannot uphold it ſelf without a lye, is not of Chriſt, but of him who is the father of lyes.</p>
                  <p>You proceed, <hi>And whereas they ſay our Miniſtry is Antichriſtian, becauſe we were ordained by Antichriſtian Biſhops, &amp;c. You anſwer, 'Tis eaſily ſaid, but not ſo eaſily proved; for firſt you have your Ordination form Chriſt by Biſhops and Presbyters.</hi>

                  <p>The outward, you have from them; and can they give you that they had not themſelves? a paradox!</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>That you adminſter in Chriſts name, and not in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>And why not your preaching brethren miniſter in Chriſts name, not having to do with the Biſhops? but if, you did in good earneſt miniſter in Chriſts name, you would do his work, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Presbytery</hi> you ſay, <hi>is only miniſterial, whereby it teſtifies, declares and approves of thoſe whom God approves and calls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, That is the reaſon I ſuppoſe, there are ſo many approved cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ones of that Generation in the Nation at preſent as there are; if in ſome, pride, covetouſneſs, ignorance, malice, treachery, blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſtineſs, &amp;c. In others, looſneſs of life, prophaneſs, drunkenneſs, whoring, &amp;c. may declare men to be the called of God, you have as much to ſay for your ſelves as any people in the world &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, You ſay, <hi>The Biſhops were not Antichriſtian, becauſe by their life and Doctrine they have witneſſed againſt Antichriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That was not as Biſhops; I do not ſay becauſe Biſhops and Prieſts too are Antichriſtian, that therefore there are no honeſt men amongſt them; for the Lords people are and have been in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and the Lord cals them to come forth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18 4.</p>
                  <p>I deny not, but that <hi>Ridley, Cranmer, Latimer, &amp;c.</hi> might be honeſt men; yet not as Biſhops; their witneſſing againſt particular errors, of which they were enformed, adds no whit to their Office, it makes them Biſhops never the more; no more then the witneſs of all the reſt againſt the ſame errors, made them Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>3. You ſay, <hi>They were Miniſters, and Ordained you, not as Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, but as Presbyters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You juggle with the buſineſs, you anabaptiſe or rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſe them; it may be contrary to their minds; who knows not, that not long ſince, the name of <hi>Presbyter</hi> was a ſtranger amongſt us, and to your ſelves too: Therefore to ſay, that they did it not as <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but as <hi>Presbyters,</hi> is a juggling ſhift, and ſavors of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance too, elſe why in the ſecond place, is not <hi>Epiſcopos</hi> an Over-feer? as good Scripture, as ancient, as honourable, and as uſeful as <hi>Presbyteros</hi> an <hi>Elder?</hi> but only change of names to delude people, as if there muſt of neceſſity be ſome great reformation, when the name is changed, though the nature be the ſame, if not worſe; this hath been alwayes, and is the trick of the Devil at a dead lift, when one Form can no longer pleaſe, then to get into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and be ſure he will not mend it.</p>
                  <p>3.

                  <p>I do not affirm that all the Presbyter perſons are wicked men, yet their Office is never the honeſter; if any of you do know the Lord, and be in good earneſt, founded <hi>upon the Rock Chriſt; and yet build,</hi> as you do, <hi>wood, hay, ſtuble, that ſhall ſuffer loſs, though your ſelves be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire:</hi> Therefore do not deceive your ſelves, becauſe you meet now and then with a man of ſome honeſt principles, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Calling is good; no more then becauſe the Lord hath ſome people in <hi>Babylon</hi> under <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> therefore <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> is good. Remember it was your own ſaying, <hi>Its not one Swallow that makes a Summer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. <hi>You ſay, Admit ſome of them have been Popiſh, &amp;c. yet we muſt not condemn all the Apoſtles for one</hi> Judas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We condemn not all, although we juſtifie the Office of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them nor you there is but little 'twixt you; and I believe as few honeſt men of your Calling as any Trade in the Nation.</p>
                  <p>You conclude, <hi>Suppoſe they be wicked, Heretical, Antichriſtian that ordain, yet our Miniſtry is firm, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well ſaid for your ſelf at laſt; you have pleaded for outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Ordination, &amp;c. all this while, and now ſo it be done, it matters not who doth it, <hi>wicked, Hereticks, Antichriſt;</hi> and why not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to? I am very confident that the Devils Ordination is as good as Antichriſts? Well, but ſomething you muſt have, it ſeems; and why may not the Preaching Brethren now upon your own account preach as lawfully without any Ordination, as your ſelves with Antichriſts Ordination? the one acting in the power of the Spirit of Chriſt, the other of Antichriſt, &amp;c. But to your Arguments to prove your Call.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Argument; <hi>Thoſe whoſe Ordination was right for ſubſtance. though it fail in ſome circumſtance, yet is valid; but our Ordination was right for ſubſtance, &amp;c. we had the inward Call.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Say little of that.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That upon your own account is no part of Ordination, <hi>and the outward Call</hi> by ſucceſſion from <hi>Rome;</hi> your Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk being ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> to eſtabliſh the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith in this Nation; he accordingly accompliſhing the work, you have your Ordination by ſucceſſion from thence.</p>
                  <p>And for all the <hi>impoſition of hands, examination of life and learning,</hi>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:49506:53"/> 
                     <hi>prayer, &amp;c.</hi> you ſo much ſeem to boaſt in, its nothing but an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian form without power, a dead carcaſs without a ſoul; for neither they nor you know what the Gift, Calling, or Work of the Miniſtery of Chriſt is, but glory in the fleſhly form without, being ignorant of, and for the moſt part enemies to the Power, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Argument. <hi>If Baptiſm of Miniſters in times of Popery was true Baptiſm, though corrupted, &amp;c. the Miniſters, though corrupted, were true Miniſters; therefore you muſt be true Miniſters, though corrupted;</hi> I ſuppoſe this to be the intention of your Argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> You have now hit the nail upon the head, and faſtned it like a Maſter builder.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then I deny either their or your Baptiſm to be any Baptiſm at all; for believe it, theirs is as good as yours, never a beſt, but aninven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Antichriſtian Cuſtome and Form, for which there is no warrant, either in Law or Goſpel, or Preſident of any true Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You do well to rank your ſelves with the Miniſtry of <hi>Rome;</hi> for they are by Office your brethren; from thence you come, and thither you muſt return, &amp;c. a grounded Argument to prove your Call: If the Miniſtry of <hi>Rome</hi> be true, then you are true; but they are; <hi>Ergo.</hi> this is the ſumm of your Argument.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Argument. <hi>If the Papiſts diſclaim us as having no Call from them, then our Calling cannot be Antichriſtian; but they diſclaim us, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Your jangling and differing each with other, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching one another, argues not the truth of what you ſay; for its known, and your ſelves know, that by Succeſſion, your Ordination came from thence, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. They do not ſay, That your Ordination in its riſe came not from them, but in the preſent its not approved of, or executed by them, by reaſon of ſome ſmal differences between you.</p>
                  <p>3. Grant by way of conceſſion, that if what you ſay were truth; is there but one Antichriſt in the world? you ſay it cannot be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian; Doth not the Apoſtle ſay there are many Antichriſts in the world.</p>
                  <p>4. Argument. <hi>If your Ordination be Antichriſtian, then cannot you with modeſty accuſe us: But your Ordination is Antichriſtian,</hi> Ergo.</p>
                  <p>A goodly Argument Sir I for if it were truth that you ſay, becauſe <hi>ours is Antichriſtian,</hi> therefore yours may be ſo by a Law; learned Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick! As to the Ordination you mention by the people, I know
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49506:53"/> none ſuch in the formal way you pretend, Election being the ſumm of all, and that lieth in the people: the power, or gift of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination in the form being wanting, its but a form without a power; yet I believe that the power both of Election and Ordination lieth in the Church; and if Ordination be ſo adminiſtred as you ſay, the Church appointing ſome of her Members unto it, they are a lawful Presbytery to do it, ſo far as the power accompanies it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>You conclude, If this be lawful, <hi>then</hi> a fortiori <hi>from the greater, yours muſt needs be lawful, learned, Orthodox Divines.</hi> Their learning and greatneſs mends the buſineſs well you think, though ignorant of, or enemies unto the Way, Truth, Churches and Miniſters of Chriſt; (the caſe is altered now ſir.)</p>
                  <p>5. Argument. <hi>Thoſe Miniſters that are elected, proved, ordained, &amp;c. according to the mind of Chriſt, cannot be Antichriſtian; but our Miniſters are ſo.</hi> Ergo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your Minor I deny; you have no ſuch Election; I have told you already, you have no Church of Chriſt, but for the moſt part are ignorant, rude, deboiſt, prophane, yet profeſſing Hypocrites: yet ſecondly, ſuch as they are, yet they never elected you before Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but you for love of the tythe pigs, &amp;c. come and take them by violence, and get their goods from them by a Law.</p>
                  <p>2. You were never proved, <hi>viz.</hi> of your knowledge of the Lord and his wayes, but of your learning; if you had the language of the Beaſt, and the ſmoke of the pit, it was enough; and as for your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, I have told you already from whence it is, I need ſay no more.</p>
                  <p>6. Argument. <hi>Thoſe Miniſters which are directly oppoſite to the Prieſts and Shavelings of Antichriſt, cannot be Antichriſtian; but ours are ſo.</hi> Ergo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> You are ſo in ſome Circumſtantials, not in the ſubſtance; for you own their Miniſtry true, their Ordinances true: and indeed you are the Sectaries and Schiſmaticks in renting from them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your account a true Church and Miniſtry, though corrupted. This your ſelf acknowledged in your ſecond Argument; and this Parſon <hi>Tilly</hi> of <hi>Compton</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> no little one in the peoples account, acknowledged in expreſs terms, that <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church, and her Miniſtry a true Miniſtry, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. There may be an oppoſition in ſome Circumſtantials, and yet a joyning in others; <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49506:54"/> 
                     <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and both againſt <hi>Judah;</hi> you are both againſt Chriſt and his Interſt, which is his people. &amp;c.</p>

Joh.</hi> 4. 28.</p>
                  <p>You inſtance in <hi>Paul</hi> proving his Apoſtleſhip, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2. that is but in particular to them, not that converſion of ſouls proves the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but the work; I deny not but there might be ſome men of honeſty, and godly men, though in darkneſs in part, by whom God might work for converſion; yet this juſtifies not the Office.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>3. Moſt of the converſion you ſo much boaſt of, was but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49506:54"/> from ſin to Duty, not from ſin to God, as many can, and have witneſſed, being with <hi>Paul</hi> made partakers of another Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion both from ſin, and reſting upon duty to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You ſeem to make much of our ſeparating from you in time of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; that its a greater ſin then many are aware of, to ſeparate from a Church that profeſſeth ſo much readineſs to conform to the Rule, and that never was ſeparation from the Chuch ſo unwarrantable as now it is, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>2. Your work, if you would do the Lords work, is, not to reform the old, but to begin anew upon the right foundation, by a right rule, to a right end: then ſhould we rejoyce in you, and joyn with you &amp;c.</p>
